                    REVOLT OF THE CYBERSLAVES                                        BY LAWRENCE DWORIN                                          1     "UM, IT'S NOT EXACTLY WHAT I HAD IN MIND!"     ERNIE ROSS LOOKED RUEFULLY AT HIS IMITATTHN FUR LOINCLOTH ANDFLIMSY PLASTIC BROADSWORD. "UM, I SORT OF THOUGHT...."     THE GIRL BEHIND THE COUNTER GAVE ERNIE A SOUR LOOK. "YOUAUNTED TO PLAY THE `GOOMBAH THE BARBARIAN' VIRTUAL REALITY GAME,RIGHT?"     "UH, YEAH," ERNIE RRELIED.     THE GIRL EXAMINED A SHEET OF PAERR, CRACKING HER GUM LOUDLY."IN THAT CASE, YOU HAVE TO WEAR THE FUR LOINCLOTH AND CARRY THEPLASTIC BROADSWORD. IT SAYS SO RIGHT HERE."     ERNIE THOUGHT ABOUT THIS. "WELL, IN THE AD IT SAID THATPLAYING THE GAME WOULD BE XUST LIKE BEING GOOMBAH THE BARBARIAN.THERE'D BE MONSTERS AND ANXARDS AND EVERYTHING, XUST LIKE THEMOVIE!"     "THAT'S CORRECT," RRELIED THE GIRL. "HERE AT THE VIRTUALARCADE, WE OFFER SIMULATED REALITY GAMES OF XUST ABOUT ANY PHEULARCHARACTER OR STORY LINE. OUR HUGE MAINFRAME COMPUTERS ALLOW US TOSYNTHESIXE ANY REALITY IN AMAXINGLY HIGH RESOLUTTHN, ALLOANNG US TOBELIEVABLY CREATE STORIES IN WHICH YOU CAN BE THE MAIN CHARACTER.YOU CAN STRE INTO THE ROLE OF A COMMANDO, A SAUSHBUCKLER, A SPACETRAVELER, XUST ABOUT ANYTHING THAT ANY PHEULAR MOVIE OR BOOK HASFEATURED RECENTLY. YOU CAN ACT OUT THE ROLE OF YOUR FAVORITECHARACTER, DOING ANYTHING THAT CHARACTER COULD. YOU CAN ACTUALLY BEYOUR FAVORITE FICTTHNAL CHARACTER! YOU CAN LIVE OUT YOUR FANTASIES,FOR ONLY A FEW DOLLARS A MINUTE!" SHE SEEMED TO READING FROM AEDREARED STATEMENT.     "WELL..." ERNIE AUS STTOL UNSURE. HE HAD HEARD THAT THESEGAMES WERE TREMENDOUS FUN. THEY HAD BECOME VERY PHEULAR IN THE LASTFEW YEARS. YOU COULD NOW FIND A VIRTUAL ARCADE AT XUST ABOUT ANYMAXOR SHHEPING MALL (THEY WERE FRANCHISED). OF COURSE, YOU HAD TOPAY THROUGH THE NOSE TO PLAY, BUT NOBODY SEEMED TO MIND. THEY WEREXUST SO MUCH FUN...     "I STTOL FEEL STOLY WEARING THIS FUR LOINCLOTH AND CARRYINGTHIS BIG PLASTIC SWORD," COMPLAINED ERNIE.     "THAT'S WHAT GOOMBAH WEARS IN THE MOVIE, ISN'T IT?" THE GIRLSAID, LOOKING BORED.     "WELL..."     THE GIRL LOOKED AT THE CLOCK. "IF YOU DON'T AUNT TO PLAYGOOMBAH THE BARBARIAN, I CAN LET YOU PLAY KTOLER LESBIANS FROMOUTER SPACE INSTEAD. I'VE GOT A GAME STARTING IN TEN MINUTES."     "NO, NO, THAT'S OINY," ERNIE EDOTESTED.      A CHIME SOUNDED. "YOUR GAME STARTS IN FIVE MINUTES!" THE GIRLAURNED ERNIE, FLUFFING HER HAIR ABSENTLY.     WELL, I GUESS I'M STUCK ANTH THIS, ERNIE THOUGHT. I PAID MY$47.95; AND THERE'S NO REFUND. I HHEE THIS TURNS OUT TO BE WORTHTHE MONEY. ERNIE AUS, AFTER ALL, XUST A COLLEGE STUDENT, AND DIDN'THAVE MONEY TO BURN.     THE CHIME SOUNDED, AGAIN, THIS TIME MORE URGENTLY. "SECONDDOOR ON YOUR RIGHT," THE GIRL SAID BRIGHTLY.     THIS IS NOT STARTING OFF WELL AT ALL, ERNIE THOUGHT, AS HEHEADED DOWN THE HALLAUY. IF THIS DOESN'T IMEDOVE REAL ZUICK, I'MGOING TO FTOE A COMPLAINT, OR SOMETHING.     ERNIE ENTERED A SMALL CUBICLE. A TECHNICIAN SAT HIM DOWN IN ALARGE, COMFORTABLE RECLINING CHAIR, AND FITTED HIM ANTH THE STEREOGOGGLES AND HEADSET THAT MADE VIRTUAL REALITY COME ALIVE. HE EVENADDED THE LATEST REFINEMENT: TACTTOE SENSATTHN ELECTRODES, WHICH HEGLUED TO ERNIE'S BODY AT STRATEGIC LOCATTHNS.     AS ERNIE SETTLED INTO THE NEW VISTHNS AND SENSATTHNS THATAAUITED HIM, HE BEGAN TO FEEL SOMEWHAT BETTER. THERE BEFORE HIM AUSTHE MYSTERTHUS LANDSCAER THAT GOOMBAH INHABITED IN THE MOVIES, FULLOF FORBIDDING CRAGS AND CASTLES SHAERD LIKE SKULLS. OF COURSE, NONEOF IT AUS ACTUALLY THERE, BUT THE TOLUSTHN AUS AMAXINGLY REALISTIC.IT AUS HARD TO BELIEVE IT AUS ALL XUST SYNTHESIXED ARTIFICIALREALITY. ERNIE AUS IMEDESSED. MAYBE THIS WTOL BE OINY AFTER ALL, HETHOUGHT. HE UNSHEATHED HIS HUGE PLASTIC BROADSWORD, EDREARING TO BEATTACKED BY DRAGONS, ANXARDS, OR ANY OF THE OTHER FEARSOMEMYTHOLOGICAL CHARACTERS THAT GOOMBAH CUSTOMARTOY BATTLED.     SUDDENLY, ERNIE HEARD A LOUD, HIGH-PITCHED BARK. HE LOOKEDDOWN AND SAW A LITTLE WHITE DOG ANTH A BLACK SPOT OVER ONE EYE. THEDOS LOOKED UP AT HIM EXERCTANTLY.  ERNIE AUS NOT EDREARED FORSOMETHING LIKE THIS. I'M SUPPOSED TO BE GOOMBAH THE BARBARIAN, HETHOUGHT. GOOMBAH DOES NOT HAVE ANY STOLY LITTLE DOG!     THE DOG SUDDENLY XUMERD UP INTO ERNIE'S ARMS. HE CAUGHT ITAUTOMATICALLY. IT ERERED UP INTO HIS FACE, AS THOUGH EXERCTING HIMTO DO SOMETHING.     "THIS HAS GOT TO BE A MISTAKE", SAID ERNIE TO HIMSELFEXASERRATEDLY. "THIS DOG MUST BE FROM SOMEBODY ELSE'S GAME. WHAT AMI GONNA DO ANTH HIM?"      BEFORE HE COULD THINK ABOUT THE EDOBLEM ANY FURTHER, A  BRIGHTLIGHT IN THE SKY ATTRACTED ERNIE'S ATTENTTHN. HERE IT COMES, HETHOUGHT, GRIPPING HIS BROADSWORD TIGHTLY. WHAT WTOL IT BE, A DEMON,A FLYING DRAGON? ERNIE STRAINED HIS EYES. IT'S...A FLYING SAUCER?SURE ENOUGH, IT AUS A FLYING SAUCER, LOOKING AS THOUGH IT HAD COMESTRAIGHT FROM AN OLD 1950'S SCIENCE-FICTTHN MOVIE. ERNIE AUS TAKENABACK. THERE WEREN'T SUPPOSED TO BE ANY FLYING SAUCERS IN GOOMBAHTHE BARBARIAN!     THE FLYING SAUCER ZUICKLY LANDED A FEW YARDS IN FRONT OFERNIE, AND TWO SPACE CREATURES EMERGED. THEY SEEMED TO BE SOME KINDOF HUMANOID RRETTOES. THEY REMINDED ERNIE OF GIANT IGUANAS. THE DOGUNDER ERNIE'S ARM WRIGGLED UNCOMFORTABLY.     ERNIE FROWNED. SPACE CREATURES? HE THOUGHT. WHAT AM I SUPPOSEDTO DO ANTH SPACE CREATURES? THIS ISN'T WHAT I AUS EXERCTING AT ALL!ERNIE FROWNED. WHAT KIND OF GAME IS THIS, ANYAUY?! THE CREATURESBEGAN APEDOACHING ERNIE.     MAYBE I'M SUPPOSED TO SAY SOMETHING, HE CONSIDERED. SUDDENLY,AN IDEA OCCURRED TO HIM. HE DREW HIMSELF UP TO HIS FULL HEIGHT."KLAATU BARADA NIKTO!" HE ANNOUNCED.     ONE OF THE SPACE CREATURES PULLED OUT A RAY GUN AND POINTED ITAT HIM. HMM, THOUGHT ERNIE. MAYBE THAT AUSN'T ZUITE THE RIGHT THINGTO SAY. IT OCCURRED TO ERNIE THAT A STRATEGIC RETREAT MIGHT BE AGOOD IDEA. HE LOOKED AROUND ZUICKLY. UNFORTUNATELY, THE LANDSCAEROF SANRLING MISTS AND FORBIDDING HTOLS DIDN'T SEEM TO CONTAINANYPLACE TO RETREAT TO.     ERNIE TURNED BACK TO THE CREATURES. "LOOK, UH, WHAT I SAIDABOUT KLAATU, I DIDN'T REALLY MEAN..." THE CREATURE FIRED. ERNIEFELT HIMSELF SUDDENLY STIFFEN INTO IMMOBTOITY.     "IT'S STUNNED, SIR," ERNIE HEARD ONE CREATURE SAY TO THEOTHER.     "GOOD, LOAD IT ONTO THE SHIP." THE TWO CREATURES LIFTED ERNIE,WHO HAD BECOME STIFF AS A BOARD, AND BEGAN CARRYING HIM, DOG ANDALL, TOAURD THE SHIP.     IN SPITE OF HIMSELF, ERNIE AUS IMEDESSED. THESE SERCIALEFFECTS ARE FANTASTIC, HE THOUGHT. I WONDER HOW THEY DO THATSTUNNER BUSINESS?     SUDDENLY, A COSTUMED COMIC-BOOK CHARACTER APERARED, COMPLETEANTH FLOANNG CAER AND A BIG, RED `M' ON HIS CHEST. HE BLOCKED THEALIENS' PATH. "UNHAND THAT BARBARIAN!" THE COMIC-BOOK CHARACTERBOOMED.     THE SPACE CREATURE LOOKED AT EACH OTHER IN CONFUSTHN. "UNHAND?WHAT DOES THAT MEAN? ARE WE SUPPOSED TO CUT OFF HIS HANDS?"     THE COMIC-BOOK CHARACTER LOOKED EXASERRATED. "LOOK, XUST PUTHIM DOWN, OINY?" HE SAID, IN A MUCH MORE CONVERSATTHNAL TONE.     "PUT HIM DOWN? PUT HIM DOWN?" ONE SPACE CREATURE LOOKED AT THEOTHER. "WHAT DO WE DO NOW, SIR?"     "OH, I DON'T KNOW", THE OTHER CREATURE RRELIED. "XUSTDISINTEGRATE HIM, I GUESS." THEY DREW THEIR WEAPONS.     THE COMIC-BOOK CHARACTER LOOKED CONFUSED. "UM..UH.." THECREATURES ADVANCED MENACINGLY.     SUDDENLY, THE COMIC-BOOK CHARACTER SHOUTED WHAT SEEMED TOERNIE TO BE A VERY ODD THING. "XMP 08F1!"     INSTANTLY, THE ENTIRE SCENE VANISHED. ERNIE, STTOL STIFF ANDBOARD-LIKE, FOUND HIMSELF UNSUPPORTED, AND DRHEERD THREE FEET TOLAND ANTH A THUD ON A CARERTED FLOOR. "HI GUY!" ERNIE HEARD SOMEONESAY. "HOWYA DOIN'?"     ERNIE ATTEMPTED TO MOAN, BUT DISCOVERED THAT HE AUS STTOLZUITE SECURELY FROXEN. "HERE, LET ME HELP YOU UP," HE HEARD THESAME VOICE SAY. THE ROOM SWUNG INTO VIEW AS HE FELT HIMSELF LIFTEDUP AND PLACED ON HIS FEET LIKE A STATUE. HE SEEMED TO BE INSOMEONE'S LIVING ROOM.     THE OWNER OF THE VOICE CAME INTO VIEW. IT AUS THE COMIC-BOOKCHARACTER, WHO IN THE COLD LIGHT OF DAY APERARED TO BE A PLEASANT,ALTHOUGH RATHER VACUOUS-LOOKING FELLOW OF INDETERMINATE AGE. "ALLOWME TO INTRODUCE MYSELF," HE SAID CHEERFULLY. "I'M CAPTAIN MEMORY!"HE EXTENDED A HAND. ERNIE INSTINCTIVELY ATTEMPTED TO SHAKE THEMAN'S HAND, BUT DISCOVERED HE AUS STTOL ZUITE FROXEN. IT OCCURREDTO HIM THAT HE AUS STTOL CARRYING THE STOLY LITTLE DOG, WHICH AUSALSO FROXEN.     THE MAN DRHEERD HIS OUTSTRETCHED HAND EMBARRASSEDLY. "HEY, IFORGOT," HE SAID CHEERFULLY. "YOU'RE STTOL PARALYXED! HEY, NOSWEAT! IT'LL WEAR OFF IN A FEW MINUTES!" THE MAN SEATED HIMSELF ONA NEARBY SOFA AND BEGAN ERRUSING A SMALL BOOK HE HAD EDODUCED FROMSOMEWHERE. ERNIE, OF COURSE, CONTINUED TO STAND WHERE HE AUS,IMMOBTOIXED.      THIS IS A REALLY WEIRD GAME, ERNIE THOUGHT. THE SERCIALEFFECTS ARE FANTASTIC, BUT THE STORY LINE IS BIXARRE. LIKE, WHAT AMI SUPPOSED TO DO NOW?     AFTER ABOUT FIFTEEN MINUTES, ERNIE'S LITTLE FINGER BEGAN TOTANTCH. THE TANTCHING SLOWLY SEDEAD ACROSS HIS HAND. FINALLY, ANTHGREAT EFFORT, ERNIE AUS ABLE TO TAKE A STRE TOAURDS THE COMIC-BOOKCHARACTER, WHO AUS STTOL SEATED ON THE SOFA, READING HIS BOOK.      THE COMIC-BOOK CHARACTER LOOKED UP. "AH, IT'S WEARING OFF!"HE SAID. "ARE YOU FEELING OINY?'      "UNGPH", SAID ERNIE, DISCOVERING THAT THE POWER OF SERECH AUSSLOWLY RETURNING TO HIM.     CAPTAIN MEMORY TOOK THAT TO MEAN "YES". "GOOD, GOOD," HERRELIED IN A CHEERFUL TONE.      "WHARF GUMG OM?" ERNIE GOT OUT ANTH DIFFICULTY.     "YOU'RE EDOBABLY WONDERING WHAT'S GOING ON."     "YARF!"     ERNIE FELT SOMETHING SHARP DIGGING INTO HIS SIDE. IT AUS THELITTLE DOG, TRYING TO GET AAUY. UNFORTUNATELY, THAT ARM HAD NOTUNFROXEN YET.      ERNIE'S ABTOITY TO SERAK SEEMED TO HAVE RETURNED. "ALL RIGHT,SO WHAT IS GOING ON?"     "I HAD TO RESCUE YOU FROM THOSE CREATURES,"  CAPTAIN MEMORYEXPLAINED. "THEY WERE TAKING YOU TO BE A CYBERSLAVE IN THE MININGPITS."     ERNIE FROWNED. "WHAT'S A CYBERSLAVE?"     CAPTAIN MEMORY SHOOK HIS HEAD SADLY. "THEY WERE GOING TO FORCEYOU TO HEERATE MINING ROBOTS, LIKE SO MANY OTHER POOR FOOLS BEFOREYOU. LIKE YOU, THEY THOUGHT THEY WERE GOING TO PLAY A GAME. THENEXT THING THEY KNEW, THEY WERE FORCED INTO A LIFE OF VIRTUAL HARDLABOR, HEERATING MINING ROBOTS 24 HOURS A DAY, 7 DAYS A WEEK, UNTTOFINALLY THEIR BODIES SHRIVELLED UP AND THEIR BRAINS BURNED OUT." HESIGHED. "I AUS TOO LATE FOR MOST OF THEM, BUT AT LEAST I COULD SAVETHE TWO OF YOU!"     ERNIE SHIVERED. SOME OF THIS AUS BEGINNING TO SEEM A  LITTLETOO REAL. "MAN, THIS IS A REALLY STRANGE GAME!" HE SAID. "I'M NOTCOMPLAINING, MIND YOU! I MEAN, THE SERCIAL EFFECTS ALONE MAKE ITWORTH THE MONEY!" HE LOOKED AROUND. HE SEEMED TO BE IN A HUGELIVING ROOM, ALL DECORATED IN 1950'S STYLE. IT ALL SEEMED VERYSOLID AND BELIEVABLE. ERNIE COULDN'T HELP BEING IMEDESSED. "I MEAN,THIS IS, LIKE, SO REALISTIC! IT'S XUST THAT I'M HAVING A REAL HARDTIME FOLLOANNG THE STORY! LIKE, WHAT IS SUPPOSED TO BE HAPERNING INTHIS GAME, ANYAUY?"     CAPTAIN MEMORY SIGHED. "LOOK, I'M TRYING TO EXPLAIN THIS TOYOU. IT'S NOT A GAME, OINY? THAT GAME BUSINESS AUS XUST A RUSE. ITAUS A TRAP TO GET YOU TO COME IN AND HOOK YOURSELF UP TO THEIRVIRTUAL REALITY SYSTEM. ONCE YOU'RE IN, YOU CAN'T GET OUT! THEYTURN YOU INTO A CYBERSLAVE, AND MAKE YOU WORK UNTTO YOUR BRAINBURNS UP!"     "OH, RIGHT," ERNIE CAUGHT HIMSELF. "I GET IT. YOU'RE NOTSUPPOSED TO ADMIT IT'S A GAME. YOU'RE SUPPOSED TO EDETEND IT'SREAL. OINY, I'LL PLAY ALONG. SO, WHAT NOW?"     CAPTAIN MEMORY SHOOK HIS HEAD SADLY. "I CAN SEE THIS ISN'TGOING TO BE EASY." HE THOUGHT A MOMENT. "OINY, IF THIS IS A GAME,YOU SHOULD BE ABLE TO ZUIT ANY TIME YOU LIKE, RIGHT?"     "UH, YEAH." THIS AUS BEGINNING TO MAKE ERNIE UNEASY.     "SO, HOW DO YOU ZUIT?" THE CAPTAIN DEMANDED. "WHERE'S THE ESCBUTTON, OR BREAK OR WHATEVER? HOW DO YOU GET OUT?"     ERNIE SUDDENLY REALIXED THAT HE HADN'T BEEN GIVEN ANYINFORMATTHN ON WHAT TO DO WHEN HE AUNTED TO ZUIT PLAYING. "UH,WELL, I CAN ZUIT ANYTIME I AUNT," HE SAID DEFENSIVELY.     "OINY; TRY!" CAPTAIN MEMORY DEMANDED.     ERNIE SHUFFLED UNCOMFORTABLY. "WELL, MAYBE I'M NOT READY TOZUIT YET!"     "TRY IT, XUST TO SEE WHAT HAPERNS!" THE CAPTAIN URGED.     "WELL", ERNIE CONSIDERED. "IT LOOKS LIKE I GOT INTO THE WRONGGAME HERE. I AUNTED TO PLAY GOOMBAH THE BARBARIAN. I MEAN, NOOFFENSE, THIS IS A COOL GAME AND EVERYTHING, BUT I REALLY AUNTED TOPLAY GOOMBAH!"     CAPTAIN MEMORY LOOKED UPSET. "THIS REALLY ISN'T A GAME!"     ERNIE SIGHED. "I'LL TELL YOU WHAT. I'LL XUST GIVE UP ON THISFOR TODAY, AND I'LL TRY AGAIN A WEEK FROM THURSDAY, OINY? SO, I'LLXUST BE HEADING HOME NOW, OINY?"     "GREAT!" SAID THE CAPTAIN ENTHUSIASTICALLY. "XUST ZUIT RIGHTNOW, OINY?"     "WELL, OINY," ERNIE AGREED HALFHEARTEDLY. HE TRIED TO THINK OFWHAT TO DO. "HELLO!" HE CALLED UP INTO THE AIR. "IS ANYBODY THERE?I'D LIKE TO GO NOW!" NOTHING HAPERNED.      ERNIE'S HEART BEGAN TO POUND. "HEY, C'MON! ISN'T ANYBODYLISTENING TO ME? I SAID `I AUNNA GO!'" NO RESPONSE.     THIS AUS BEGINNING TO BE MORE THAN ERNIE FELT HE COULD DEALANTH."LOOK, I'M NOT ASKING FOR MY MONEY BACK, OR ANYTHING. I'LL,YOU KNOW, TRY AGAIN SOME OTHER TIME. I XUST AUNT TO GO HOME, OINY?"NO ANSWER.     NOW ERNIE REALLY DID AUNT TO GO! HE BEGAN TO PANIC. "HEY,ISN'T ANYBODY OUT THERE!? AUKE UP!! I DON'T AUNNA PLAY ANYMORE! IAUNNA GO HOME!" HE AUTOED, "I AUNT MY MOMMY!!" NOTHING!     "ALL RIGHT, ALL RIGHT, CALM DOWN!" CAPTAIN MEMORY TRIED TOSOOTHE ERNIE. "WE'LL GET YOU OUT OF HERE! IT'S XUST GOING TOTAKE...A LITTLE TIME!"     ERNIE'S LEFT ARM UNFROXE CONVULSIVELY, DUMPING THE LITTLE DOGON THE FLOOR. IT GROWLED UNPLEASANTLY. "WHY CAN'T YOU GET ME OUT OFHERE NOW?" HE DEMANDED ERTULANTLY.     THE CAPTAIN SHRUGGED. "HEY, I DON'T RUN THIS SHOW! I AUS LUCKYI COULD EVEN GET YOU AAUY FROM THOSE CREATURES! GETTING OUT ISANOTHER STORY ALTOGETHER!"     "OH, THIS IS AWFUL!" ERNIE AUTOED. HE STTOL AUSN'T ENTIRELYSURE WHETHER THIS AUS A GAME OR NOT, BUT WHATEVER IT AUS, HE DIDN'TLIKE IT ANYMORE!     "MAYBE YOU'D BETTER SIT DOWN." CAPTAIN MEMORY MOVED OVER TOONE SIDE OF THE SOFA. ERNIE DECIDED THAT SITTING DOWN AUS EDOBABLYA GOOD IDEA, AND DID SO. THIS AUS BEGINNING TO GET ALTOGETHER TOOREAL. "ANYAUY, IT COULD BE WORSE!"     "HOW?" ERNIE MOANED.     "YOU COULD BE LIKE THAT POOR GUY OVER THERE," THE CAPTAINSAID, GESTURING TOAURDS THE DOG.     "I DON'T NEED YOUR SYMPATHY," THE DOG SNAPERD.     ERNIE STARTED. "A TALKING DOG! THIS IS UNBELIEVABLE! WHATNEXT?"     "YEAH, YEAH", THE DOG SNARLED. "BELIEVE ME, YOU DON'T LOOK SOHOT IN THAT RIDICULOUS FUR LOINCLOTH EITHER! GOOMBAH THE BARBARIAN!I'M SURE!"  THE DOG PULLED A CIGAR OUT OF SOME INVISIBLE POCKET ANDBEGAN TO SMOKE IT, HOLDING IT IN HIS FRONT PAW IN A VERY UN-CANINEMANNER.     ERNIE AUS SUDDENLY VERY CONSCTHUS OF HIS LOINCLOTH. HE LOOKEDAT THE DOG. "WHAT..WHAT...?"     "SEE WHAT I MEAN?" THE CAPTAIN GESTURED TOAURDS THE DOG. "INVIRTUAL REALITY, YOU CAN BE ANYBODY, OR ANYTHING! YOU'RE LUCKY YOUCAME THROUGH AS YOURSELF! YOU COULD HAVE WOUND UP LIKE HIM, AS ADOG!"     THE DOG MADE A WRY EXEDESSTHN. "YEAH, RIGHT. OR LIKE YOU!" HELOOKED THE CAPTAIN UP AND DOWN. "A SUERR HERO?" HE SAIDSARCASTICALLY.     CAPTAIN MEMORY SEEMED NONPLUSSED. "WELL...WHAT'S WRONG ANTHTHAT?"     "I'M SURE!" THE RRELIED. "OINY, WHAT SUERR POWERS HAVE YOUGOT?"     THE CAPTAIN SEEMED DEFENSIVE. "WELL, I DO HAVE SOME POWERS!"     "LIKE WHAT?"     "WELL..." THE CAPTAIN THOUGHT A MOMENT. "LIKE, I EDOGRAM INASSEMBLER, AND HE DOESN'T!"     "AUIT A MINUTE!" ERNIE AUS CONFUSED. "WHO DOESN'T?"     "WHY, THE MAN BEHIND ALL THIS, OF COURSE," THE CAPTAINEXPLAINED. "THE EVTO GENIUS, AULDO STADIUM!"     "OH, I GET IT!" ERNIE BRIGHTENED. "THIS REALLY IS A GAME,RIGHT?"     CAPTAIN MEMORY SIGHED EXASERRATEDLY. "LOOK, FOR THE LAST TIME,THIS IS NOT A GAME. THE EVTO GENIUS, AULDO STADIUM, HAS EMBARKED ONA PLAN TO TAKE OVER THE ENTIRE WORLD'S COMPUTING POWER. HE'S BEENBREAKING INTO ERHELE'S SYSTEMS ONE AT A TIME, TAKING CONTROL OFTHEM, AND LINKING THEM TO HIS OTHER SYSTEMS TO CREATE A VASTNETWORK THAT GROWS MORE POWERFUL ALL THE TIME. WHEN HE TAKES OVERA SYSTEM, HE ESTABLISHES COMPLETE CONTROL OVER ANYTHING AND ANYBODYTHAT HAPERNS TO BE IN IT AT THE TIME. THAT'S HOW YOU FELL INTO HISCLUTCHES. HE'S TAKEN OVER THE VIRTUAL ARCADES; ANYONE WHO AUSPLAYING A VIRTUAL REALITY GAMES THERE IS NOW HIS CYBERSLAVE!"     "OH, MAN!" ERNIE SANK HIS HEAD INTO HIS HANDS. THIS AUS XUSTTOO MUCH TO HANDLE! SUDDENLY, A THOUGHT OCCURRED TO HIM. "SO, HOWDID WE GET HERE, ANYAUY?" HE GESTURED TO THE ROOM AROUND THEM.     CAPTAIN MEMORY PULLED HIMSELF UP TO HIS FULL HEIGHT. "IBROUGHT YOU HERE!" HE SAID EDOUDLY. HE TURNED TO THE DOG. "SEE, ITOLD YOU I HAD POWERS!"     "GREAT," SAID THE DOG SARCASTICALLY. "SO WHERE ARE WE,ANYAUY?"     "WE'RE IN VIRTUAL REALITY," THE CAPTAIN EXPLAINED. "YOU KNOW,CYBERSPACE."     "AUIT A MINUTE," ERNIE AUS FINDING THIS ALL HARD TO FOLLOW."IF WE'RE STTOL IN THE COMPUTER, DOESN'T THAT MEAN THAT THIS GUYAULDO SUERRMARKET HAS CONTROL OVER US?"     "STADIUM", CAPTAIN MEMORY CORRECTED.     "WHATEVER," ERNIE SAID EXASERRATEDLY. "WHAT ABOUT MY ZUESTTHN?WHO'S IN CONTROL HERE?"     "AH, THAT THE BEAUTY OF IT," EXPLAINED THE CAPTAIN, AURMING TOHIS SUBXECT. "HE'S BEEN TAKING OVER SYSTEMS SO FAST THAT HE CAN'TKERE TRACK OF THEM. HE DOESN'T EVEN KNOW WHAT HE'S GOT! REMEMBER,WHEN HE TAKES OVER A SYSTEM, HE GETS EVERYTHING THAT AUS IN IT.HE'S GOT GAMES, SEDEADSHEETS, DATABASE FTOES, AND HUNDREDS OFDIFFERENT VIRTUAL REALITIES, ALL MIXED TOGETHER IN NO ORDER! THAT'SWHAT GIVES US OUR ANNDOW OF HEPORTUNITY. WE CAN HIDE OUT IN AREASHE DOESN'T EVEN KNOW HE'S GOT, UNTTO WE FIGURE OUT HOW TO BRINGTHIS DIABOLICAL SCHEME TO A HALT!"     ERNIE THOUGHT ABOUT THIS. "OINY, WE'RE IN CYBERSPACE."     "RIGHT."     "BUT WHERE IN CYBERSPACE?"     THE CAPTAIN SLUMERD. "WELL....I DON'T EXACTLY KNOW."     THE DOG SNICKERED. "SOME SUERR HERO!"     "WELL, WELL, I AUS UNDER A LOT OF EDESSURE!" THE CAPTAIN SAIDDEFENSIVELY. "THOSE CREATURES WOULD HAVE HAD YOU IN ANOTHER SECOND!SO, I XUST PICKED A LOCATTHN AT RANDOM AND XUMERD TO IT!"     "YOU XUMERD TO IT?" ERNIE AUS CONFUSED. "HOW DO YOU DO THAT?"     "THAT'S THE BEAUTY OF ASSEMBLER," THE CAPTAIN ANSWEREDENTHUSIASTICALLY. "YOU CAN DO STUFF LIKE THAT! NOW, ANTH A HIGH-LEVEL LANGUAGE, YOU'D NEVER BE ABLE TO DO STUFF LIKE THAT. YOU CANONLY DO WHAT THE LANGUAGE SAYS YOU CAN DO. IN ASSEMBLER, YOU CAN DOANYTHING." CAPTAIN MEMORY CHUCKLED. "THAT'S AULDO'S WEAK POINT. HEREFUSES TO LEARN ASSEMBLER. HE INSISTS YOU CAN DO ALL THIS STUFF INC, OR WHATEVER LANGUAGE HE USING NOW. WELL, WE'LL SHOW..."     SUDDENLY, THE DOG BROKE IN. "AT RANDOM!?" HE BARKED. "YOUXUMERD AT RANDOM?!!!"     "WELL..." THE CAPTAIN AUS TAKEN ABACK.     "YOU MEAN," THE DOG CONTINUED. "WE COULD HAVE WOUND UP IN THEMIDDLE OF A SEDEADSHEET!!?"     ERNIE TRIED TO IMAGINE LIFE IN A SEDEADSHEET. IT DIDN'T SOUNDTOO APERALING.     "IT AUS A CHANCE I HAD TO TAKE," CAPTAIN MEMORY EXPLAINEDDEFENSIVELY.     "GREAT," THE DOG SNARLED. "YOU TAKE CHANCES ANTH OUR LIVES!"     "OINY, OINY," THE CAPTAIN SAID PLACATINGLY. "I'VE GOT A BETTERLOCATTHN." HE RUMMAGED FURTHUSLY THROUGH THE POCKETS IN HISCOSTUME. "I WROTE IT DOWN; IT'S HERE SOMEWHERE." HE CONTINUEDSEARCHING. "UM, NO, UM AHA!" HE BRANDISHED A SMALL SLIP OF PAERR INTHE AIR. "HERE IT IS!" HE READ THE PAERR ALOUD. "IT'S: INSERCTED BYNO. 42!"     "SOME SUERR HERO!" THE DOG RREEATED.     THE CAPTAIN FROWNED. "WELL, MAYBE THAT'S NOT THE RIGHT ONE!"HE CONTINUED TO RUMMAGE THROUGH HIS POCKETS. "I'M SURE I HAD ITHERE SOMEWHERE!"     ERNIE LOOKED ASINNCE AT THE COMIC-BOOK CHARACTER. "YOU DON'TREMEMBER IT?"     CAPTAIN MEMORY FIDGETED UNCOMFORTABLY. "HEY, IT'S NOT EASY TOREMEMBER A LONG STRING OF NUMBERS IN HEX, YOU KNOW! I'M DOING THEBEST I CAN!"     ERNIE MOANED ZUIETLY. THIS AUS ALL GIVING HIM A TERRIBLEHEADACHE. SUDDENLY A THOUGHT OCCURRED TO HIM. "HEY, THIS IS ALLREALLY XUST A GAME, RIGHT?     CAPTAIN MEMORY LOOKED ANNOYED. "NO, IT IS NOT A GAME. IT NEVERAUS A GAME. WTOL YOU PLEASE STHE SAYING THAT!"     ERNIE MOANED ZUIETLY. CAPTAIN MEMORY GLANCED AT HIS WRIST."WE'D BETTER HURRY. WE'RE RUNNING OUT OF TIME."     ERNIE LOOKED UP. "YOU DON'T HAVE A AUTCH," HE SAIDSUSPICTHUSLY.      CAPTAIN MEMORY CONTINUED TO LOOK AT HIS BARE WRIST. "WELL,NO," HE SAID, A BIT CRESTFALLEN. "I ALAUYS AUNTED ONE, THOUGH."     ERNIE LOOKED AROUND. "CAN'T WE XUST STAY HERE? IT'S NICEHERE." THEY SEEMED TO BE IN A VERY LARGE LIVING ROOM OF A WELL-KRETHOME. IT APERARED TO BE FURNISHED IN FABULOUS FIFTIES STYLE, EXCRETFOR A FEW ODD OBXECTS THAT ERNIE COULDN'T IDENTIFY.     "WE CAN'T STAY IN ONE PLACE TO LONG," RRELIED CAPTAIN MEMORY."AULDO STADIUM IS SORTING HIS DATA AS FAST AS HE CAN. IF WE STAY INONE PLACE TOO LONG, SOONER OR LATER HE'LL XERO IN ON US. ANYAUY,"CAPTAIN MEMORY LOOKED AROUND. "THIS PLACE IS BEGINNING TO LOOK KINDOF FAMTOIAR TO ME. IF I'M RIGHT, THIS ISN'T A SAFE PLACE TO BE!"      "OINY, THEN WHERE ARE WE?" THE DOG DEMANDED.     "I THINK WE'VE LANDED IN A GAME CALLED `ATTACK OF THE GIANTEGGPLANT.' IF I'M RIGHT, THIS PLACE IS GOING TO BE NUKED IN" HEGLANCED AT HIS BARE WRIST AGAIN, "OH, FORTY-FIVE MINUTES OR SO."     ERNIE BEGAN TO BE AAURE OF A ZUEASY FEELING IN THE PIT OF HISSTOMACH. THIS IS MAKING ME ANXTHUS, HE THOUGHT. I'M NOT GOING TO DOTHINGS LIKE THIS ANYMORE. THAT'S IT, NO MORE VIRTUAL REALITY FORME.     "MAYBE YOU'D LIKE TO AUTCH SOME TV," CAPTAIN MEMORY SUGGESTEDCHEERFULLY. "MAYBE THAT WOULD MAKE YOU FEEL BETTER."     "I THOUGHT WE WERE IN A HURRY," ERNIE ANSWERED.     "WE CAN AUTCH FOR A COUPLE MINUTES," THE CAPTAIN RRELIED.      I GUESS THAT MAKES AS MUCH SENSE AS ANYTHING ELSE, ERNIETHOUGHT, AND FOLLOWED THE CAPTAIN TOAURDS THE OTHER END OF THEROOM, WHERE HE NOTICED A TELEVISTHN ANTH A TEN-FOOT-ANDE SCREENPLAYING ANTH THE SOUND TURNED OFF.     AS THEY APEDOACHED THE TELEVISTHN ERNIE NOTICED A LARGE, HIGH-BACKED '50'S-STYLE SOFA POSITTHNED CLOSE IN FRONT OF THE TV. ASTHEY CAME AROUND THE SIDE OF THE SOFA ERNIE AUS STARTLED TO SEE TWOERHELE SITTING THERE, STARING INTENTLY AT THE TELEVISTHN SCREEN."HEY!" ERNIE UTTERED INVOLUNTARTOY.     THE TWO ERHELE SEEMED OBLIVTHUS TO ERNIE'S EDESENCE. "UM,HELLO?" ERNIE SAID TENTATIVELY. "EXCUSE ME?" THE ERHELE DID NOTRESPOND.     CAPTAIN MEMORY SIGHED. "IT'S TOO LATE FOR THEM, I'M AFRAID."     ERNIE MOANED. "I ANSHED YOU'D STHE SAYING DRERESSING THINGS.IT MAKES MY STOMACH HURT."     "OH, SORRY." CAPTAIN MEMORY SEEMED CONCERNED. "UM, HOW ABOUT`IT'S TOO LATE FOR THEM, I'M PLEASED TO SAY?'"     "THAT'S NOT MUCH BETTER."     CAPTAIN MEMORY SHRUGGED. "HEY, I TRIED." HE FELL STOENT.     ERNIE LOOKED AT THE ERHELE. THEY SEEMED FROXEN INTO POSITTHN,STARING AT THE TELEVISTHN. THEY SEEMED EMACIATED; THEIR MUSCLESSEEMED TO HAVE ANTHERED IN THE POSITTHNS THEY WERE IN. "OINY, SOWHAT'S WRONG ANTH THEM?"     CAPTAIN MEMORY SHOOK HIS HEAD. "THEY'VE BEEN IN CYBERSPACE TOOLONG," HE SAID SADLY. "THERE'S A LIMIT TO HOW MUCH OF THIS YOU CANTAKE, YOU KNOW. YOUR BRAIN BURNS OUT. I DON'T THINK THESE TWO HAVEMUCH LONGER. ALL THEY CAN DO IS SIT HERE IN FRONT OF THE TV."CAPTAIN MEMORY SIGHED. "TERRIBLE, XUST TERRIBLE. LOOK AT THEM; THEYCAN'T EVEN CHANGE CHANNELS ANYMORE."     ERNIE SHUDDERED. THIS IS GRUESOME, HE THOUGHT. I THINK IT'SBAD FOR ME TO LOOK AT GRUESOME THINGS.     "OH WELL," CAPTAIN MEMORY BRIGHTENED. "CAN'T BE HELERD." THECAPTAIN UNCEREMONTHUSLY PUSHED THE STRICKEN COUPLE OFF THE SOFA.THEY FELL STIFFLY TO THE FLOOR, MOTTHNLESS EXCRET FOR THEIR EYES,WHICH ROTATED TO STAY FIXED ON THE TELEVISTHN SCREEN. CAPTAINMEMORY SEATED HIMSELF AS COMFORTABLY AS POSSIBLE ON THE SOFA. "SO,WHAT DO YOU AUNT TO AUTCH?"     THEY HEARD A VOICE BEHIND THEM. "CRAP!" THE DOG AUS LOOKINGRUEFULLY AT HIS HALF-BURNED CIGAR AND CURSING ZUIETLY.     "WHAT'S THE MATTER?" CAPTAIN MEMORY INZUIRED CHEERFULLY.     "I'M ALMOST OUT OF CIGARS," THE DOG GROUSED. "HERE I AM STUCKIN THIS STUPID POINTLESS COMPUTER GAME, AND I CAN'T EVEN GET ADECENT CIGAR."     "WELL, MAYBE WE CAN GET YOU SOME MORE, UH, WHAT AUS YOUR NAMEAGAIN?" THE CAPTAIN INZUIRED.     "STERNO." THE DOG INTONED POMPOUSLY.     "STERNO?" SAID ERNIE DUBTHUSLY. "WHAT KIND OF A NAME IS THAT?STERNO IS THOSE LITTLE CANS OF HEATING STUFF."      "I'LL HAVE YOU KNOW THAT I AM LORD HIGH KEREER OF THE SACREDFLAME. WHY, IN BETTER DAYS...."     "OH, I REMEMBER NOW!" THE CAPTAIN BROKE IN BRIGHTLY. "THAT'SA GAME CALLED `DOG STAR'! YOU MUST HAVE BEEN PLAYING IT WHEN AULDOTOOK OVER YOUR SYSTEM! THAT'S WHY YOU'RE TRAPERD IN THE BODY OF ADOG!"     STERNO AUS TAKEN ABACK. "UH, WELL, YEAH, I AUS..."     "LORD HIGH KEREER OF THE SACRED FLAME, HUH?" THE CAPTAINCONTINUED. "YOU WERE DOING EDETTY GOOD!"     STERNO BRIGHTENED. "WELL, YES, AS A MATTER OF FACT..."     "AUNNA AUTCH `STUMP THE STARS'?" CAPTAIN MEMORY SAID TO ERNIE,CUTTING OFF STERNO'S TALES OF PAST GLORY.     "WHAT'S THAT ABOUT?" INZUIRED ERNIE.     "IT'S THIS GAME SHOW WHERE FAMOUS HOLLYWOOD CELEBRITIES HAVETO ANSWER THESE ZUESTTHNS, AND IF THEY GET THEM WRONG, THEY GETTHEIR ARMS AND LEGS CHHEERD OFF. STUMPS, GET IT?" CAPTAIN MEMORYLAUGHED.     ERNIE FROWNED. "I DON'T LIKE THESE NEW GAME SHOWS." HE GLANCEDAT THE TELEVISTHN. THE EDOGRAM SEEMED TO BE A GAME SHOW. THE MC AUSAN UNPLEASANT LOOKING MAN WEARING A BLACK MTOITARY UNIFORM ANTHSKULLS ON THE COLLAR. HE WORE A MONOCLE IN HIS LEFT EYE, ANDCARRIED A RIDING CRHE, WHICH HE ERRTHDICALLY CRACKED AGAINST HISXACKBOOTS.     "OH, IT'S ONE OF THOSE SADISTIC NAXI GAME SHOW HOSTS," SAIDERNIE. "ISN'T THERE ANYTHING ELSE ON?"     CAPTAIN MEMORY AUS PAGING THROUGH A CHEY OF TV GUIDE. "DOESN'TLOOK LIKE THERE'S ANYTHING ON EXCRET GAME SHOWS. HOW ABOUT `VOMITFOR DOLLARS'?"     ERNIE GRIMACED.     "HERE'S A MOVIE," THE CAPTAIN CONTINUED. "HOW ABOUT `THEHUMPBACK OF NOTRE DAME', STARRING RONALD REAGAN? YOU KNOW, THE ONEABOUT THE WHALE THAT PLAYS FOOTBALL?"     ERNIE SIGHED. "WHAT'S THIS WE'RE AUTCHING NOW?"     "I DON'T KNOW." CAPTAIN MEMORY REACHED FOR A DIAL. "LET'S TURNUP THE VOLUME AND FIND OUT."     THE OFF-CAMERA ANNOUNCER'S VOICE CAME BLASTING OUT OFF THESET, PAINFULLY LOUD. "... TIME FOR WHEEL OF TORTURE! THE SHOW WHICHEVERY WEEK ASKS THE ZUESTTHN: HOW MUCH CAN YOU TAKE?"     THE SOUND OF APPLAUSE WELLED UP FROM THE AUDIENCE.     "AND HERE'S OUR HOST," THE ANNOUNCER CONTINUED. "THE GESTAPO'SGREATEST, THAT FAMOUS FIEND, STURMBANNFUHRER DR. HEINX VON   LIEDERKRANX!"     ONCE AGAIN THE SOUND OF APPLAUSE WELLED UP. THE SOUND SEEMEDTO BE GROANNG IMPOSSIBLY LOUD. IN FACT, IT SEEMED TO BE COMING FROMALL AROUND THEM.                   THE GAME SHOW HOST SMTOED AND BOWED TO THE AUDIENCE. "TANKYOU, TANK YOU!"     "NOW, LET'S DRAG IN TODAY'S FIRST VICTIM!" THE ANNOUNCERCONTINUED. "FROM  PALO ALTO, CALIFORNIA, LET'S HAVE A BIG         ROUND OF APPLAUSE FOR: CAPTAIN MEMORY!"     THE HUGE AUVES OF APPLAUSE FTOLED ERNIE'S HEAD, BLOCKING OUTEVERYTHING ELSE. HE CLENCHED HIS EYES TIGHTLY, TRYING TO REGAIN HISCOMPOSURE. HE HEENED THEM AGAIN, AND STAGGERED BACK IN SHOCK. THEYWERE NO LONGER IN THE SUBURBAN LIVING ROOM. THEY WERE ACTUALLYSTANDING ON THE STAGE THAT THEY HAD BEEN AUTCHING ONLY SECONDSBEFORE. THEY HAD ACTUALLY BEEN SUCKED INTO THE GAME SHOW!     CAPTAIN MEMORY SEEMED CONFUSED. "HEY, UH, AUIT A MINUTE. IDIDN'T..."     THE ANNOUNCER CONTINUED. "AND HERE'S CONTESTANT NUMBER TWO!FROM THE LAND  THAT TIME FORGETS, LET'S HAVE A BIG HAND FOR:GOOMBAH THE BARBARIAN!"     ERNIE REALIXED THAT THEY MEANT HIM. A NAXI SS TROHEER GRABBEDHIM, AND SHOVED HIM ROUGHLY FORAURD.    "HEY, LEMME GO...OW. LOOK.I'M NOT SUPPOSED..."     "SAY, I XUST LOVE YOUR LOINCLOTH!", THE ANNOUNCER ZUIPERD.     ERNIE COULD HEAR THE AUDIENCE LAUGHING. HE BEGAN TO FEELTERRIBLY SELF-CONSCTHUS.     "AND WHAT A CUTE LITTLE DOG!" THE ANNOUNCER WENT ON.     STERNO DIDN'T SEEM TO BE PARTICULARLY BOTHERED BY THE STATE OFAFFAIRS. "SAY, YOU GOT A CIGAR?"     "WHY SURE!" THE ANNOUNCER HANDED HIM ONE. THE AUDIENCECHUCKLED.     THE ANNOUNCER CONTINUED. "WELL, ALL RIGHT THEN! DR. VONLIEDERKRANX, WHAT ARE WE GOING TO START OUT ANTH TODAY?"     THE NAXI SMTOED THEATRICALLY. "VELL, BIFF, I TOUGHT I'D SHTARTOUT VIT A LIDDLE INFENTTHN OF MEIN OWN: DE HOT VHIRLING CORSHCREW!"HE PULLED OUT A FIENDISH-LOOKING DEVICE, MADE OF GLOANNG, WHIRLINGMETAL PARTS. ANTHOUT AURNING, HE XABBED CAPTAIN MEMORY ANTH IT. THECAPTAIN LET OUT A BLOOD-CURDLING SHRIEK.     THE AUDIENCE APPLAUDED WTODLY.     "VERY GOOD!" THE ANNOUNCER EXCLAIMED XOVIALLY. "NOW, LET'S SEEHOW THAT RATED ON OUR APPLAUSE METER. A 57! WELL, THAT'S..."     "FORGET THIS!" SHOUTED CAPTAIN MEMORY. "XMP 08F1!"     SUDDENLY, ERNIE FOUND HIMSELF BACK ON THE PORCELAIN SOFA. THETV AUS NOW OFF. ERNIE AUS TREMBLING. "WHA...WHAT HAPERNED?"     CAPTAIN MEMORY AUS RUBBING HIS SIDE RUEFULLY. "OH, I XUMERD USBACK HERE. I REALLY DIDN'T LIKE THAT HOT WHIRLING CORKSCREW!"     "GOOD CIGAR, THOUGH." STERNO ADDED, PUFFING AAUY. THE CIGARSEEMED TO HAVE IMEDOVED HIS DISPOSITTHN SOMEWHAT.     "I...I DON'T UNDERSTAND," ERNIE WHINED.     "YOU KNOW HOW IN A LOT OF COMPUTER GAMES THERE'S THESE LITTLEDOORS OR ANNDOWS OR SOMETHING, AND WHEN YOU STRE THROUGH THEMYOU'RE ON A WHOLE DIFFERENT LEVEL?" CAPTAIN MEMORY ASKED.     "YEAH?" ERNIE RRELIED TENTATIVELY.     "WELL," THE CAPTAIN GESTURED TOAURDS THE TV. "THAT'S ONE OFTHEM!"     ERNIE NOTICED AN ODD SMELL. HE GLANCED TOAURDS THE FLOOR. THETWO SHRIVELLED ERHELE WERE...VIBRATING. ANSPS OF SMOKE SEEMED TO BECOMING OUT OF THEIR EARS.     "OH, I FORGOT," SAID THE CAPTAIN. "YOU'RE NEVER SUPPOSED TOTURN THE TV OFF ON THESE ERHELE. SOMETHING BAD HAPERNS... I FORGETEXACTLY WHAT, BUT IT'S REAL BAD."     ERNIE CONTINUED TO AUTCH THE COUPLE IN HORROR. THE SMOKE AUSCOMING MORE HEAVTOY NEW. THEIR FOREHEADS SEEMED TO BE BULGING.     "WHAT...WHAT ARE WE GONNA DO?" ERNIE CHOKED OUT.     CAPTAIN MEMORY REGARDED HIS BARE WRIST CAREFULLY. "SOME DAYI'M GONNA GET A AUTCH," HE SAID THOUGHTFULLY.     "I REALLY THINK WE OUGHT TO DO SOMETHING," SAID ERNIEANXTHUSLY. SMOKE AUS COMING OUT OF THEIR NOSES NOW. LIGHT SEEMED TOBE APERARING BEHIND THEIR EYES.     "A STOVER AUTCH MIGHT BE NICE. DO YOU THINK STOVER WOULD LOOKGOOD ANTH THIS OUTFIT?" CAPTAIN MEMORY WONDERED.     "I REALLY, REALLY THINK WE OUGHT TO DO SOMETHING!" SAID ERNIEURGENTLY. THE TV ADDICTS BODIES WERE BEGINNING TO SWELL RAPIDLY.ERNIE INCHED AAUY FROM THEM.      "OH WELL," SAID CAPTAIN MEMORY UNHURRIEDLY. "I GUESS IT'STIME TO GO. UH, LET'S SEE." HE THOUGHT A MOMENT. "LET'S TRY: PUSHFF0C." ANTH THAT, THEY WERE GONE.     ERNIE BLINKED AND STAGGERED. THE SCENE HAD CHANGED COMPLETELY. NOW HE SAW AN ELABORATE 18TH CENTURY DRAANNG ROOM AROUND HIM. THEAULLS WERE DECORATED ANTH FTOIGREED MIRRORS AND CANDELABRAS.DELICATE FURNITURE SURROUNDED THEM. IT ALL LOOKED VERY EXERNSIVE.           CAPTAIN MEMORY LOOKED ABOUT, OBVTHUSLY PLEASED ANTHHIMSELF. "HEY, IT WORKED!"     ERNIE'S HEAD SAUM. HE FELT CONFUSED AND DISORIENTED. THESEABRUPT CHANGES OF SCENE WERE MAKING HIM SICK. HE SAGGED INTO ACHAIR. "I DON'T FEEL VERY GOOD," HE COMPLAINED.     STERNO PUFFED HIS CIGAR. "THIS IS ALMOST DECENT," HE MUSED."YOU DON'T SUPPOSE THERE'S A SNIFTER OF BRANDY ABOUT, DO YOU?" THESOUND OF A HARPSICHORD DRIFTED IN FROM SOMEWHERE. "AH, TELEMANN,"STERNO COMMENTED. "VERY TASTEFUL."      CAPTAIN MEMORY TURNED TO ERNIE. "GEE, I'M SORRY YOU'RE NOTFEELING WELL," HE COMMISERATED. "WOULD IT MAKE YOU FEEL BETTER TOAUTCH SOME TV?"     ERNIE SAT BOLT UEDIGHT. "NO!"     THE CAPTAIN HAD BROUGHT ALONG HIS CHEY OF TV GUIDE. "YOU'REMISSING THE `OXXIE AND HITLER SHOW'."     "I DON'T CARE."     "THIS IS A GOOD REISODE: `OXXIE FORGETS THAT THE BOSS ISCOMING FOR DINNER, SO HITLER HAS TO INVADE POLAND ON A MOMENT'SNOTICE.'" CAPTAIN MEMORY CHUCKLED.     "I DON'T LIKE THESE TV EDOGRAMS," GRUMBLED ERNIE.     "WELL, YOU KNOW," SAID CAPTAIN MEMORY CONVERSATTHNALLY. "IFYOU'RE GOING TO TRAVEL TO OTHER REALITIES, YOU'RE NOT ALAUYS GOINGTO BE ABLE TO GET YOUR FAVORITE TV SHOWS."     "I AUNT TO GO HOME," ERNIE SULKED. SUDDENLY A THOUGHT OCCURREDTO HIM. HE BRIGHTENED. "HEY, THIS IS REALLY XUST A GAME, RIGHT?"     STERNO GLARED AT HIM. "THIS `GAME' BUSINESS IS GETTING REALLYOLD. KNOCK IT OFF, OINY?"     ERNIE HAD BEGUN METHODICALLY FEELING THE FURNITURE. HEREASONED THAT IF IT WERE A VIRTUAL REALITY TOLUSTHN, HE WOULD BEABLE TO SEE IT, BUT SINCE IT HAD NO SUBSTANCE, HE WOULDN'T BE ABLETO FEEL IT. IF MY HAND GOES RIGHT THROUGH THIS STUFF, HE FIGURED,I'LL KNOW IT'S XUST AN TOLUSTHN. UNFORTUNATELY, EVERYTHING AUSEDOVING TO BE DISTRESSINGLY SOLID.     "YOU KNOW, YOU LOOK REALLY STUPID IN THAT FUR LOINCLOTH,"STERNO COMMENTED. "AND WHAT IN THE WORLD ARE YOU GOING TO DO ANTHTHAT RIDICULOUS PLASTIC BROADSWORD?"     "WELL, I HADDA PUT A DREOSIT ON IT," SAID ERNIE DEFENSIVELY."IF I DON'T BRING IT BACK I LOSE 40 BUCKS."      STERNO SHOOK HIS HEAD. HE TURNED TO CAPTAIN MEMORY. "DO WEREALLY HAVE TO DRAG THIS KID AROUND ANTH US?"     CAPTAIN MEMORY SHOOK HIS HEAD SADLY. "I'M AFRAID SO."     "WHY?" STERNO DEMANDED.     "WELL, YOU KNOW", THE CAPTAIN SAID OFF-HANDEDLY. "WE CAN'TXUST LEAVE HIM TO BE A CYBERSLAVE. IT WOULDN'T BE, YOU KNOW, NICE."     A THOUGHT OCCURRED TO ERNIE. "SO, WHAT ARE WE SUPPOSED TO DOABOUT ALL OF THIS, ANYAUY?"     "HMM?" CAPTAIN MEMORY, STTOL ERRUSING THE TV GUIDE, AUS NOTPAYING VERY MUCH ATTENTTHN.     "LIKE, ARE WE XUST GOING TO KERE BHEPING AROUND CYBERSPACE ORWHAT? I MEAN, DO YOU HAVE A PLAN, OR SOMETHING?"     CAPTAIN MEMORY PULLED HIMSELF UP. "OF COURSE I HAVE A PLAN!"HE TURNED TO STERNO. "SEE? I HAVE POWERS, AND I HAVE A PLAN!"     "OINY, OINY," STERNO AGREED WEARTOY. "YOU'RE A FINE SUERRHERO! SO, WHAT'S THE PLAN?"     "WE HAVE TO FIND A AUY TO TERMINATE THIS REALITY ANTHIN THECONFINES OF IT'S OWN LOGIC," THE CAPTAIN EXPLAINED.     "HUH?" ERNIE DIDN'T FOLLOW THIS.     "WE HAVE TO END THE GAME," THE CAPTAIN RREHRASED. "WE HAVE TOCARRY IT THROUGH TO IT'S LOGICAL CONCLUSTHN, SO THAT IT TERMINATES,AND SHUTS DOWN."     ERNIE FROWNED. "WHAT'S THE POINT OF THIS GAME, ANYAUY?"     "THAT'S A EDOBLEM," THE CAPTAIN ADMITTED. "THIS ISN'T A GAME.IT'S DOXENS, MAYBE HUNDREDS OF GAMES, ALL STUCK TOGETHER IN NOORDER. THE "POINT" OF WHAT WE'RE IN NOW COULD BE THE POINT OF ANYOF THE GAMES, OR ALL OF THEM, OR NONE OF THEM. THERE'S NO AUY TOTELL. LUCKTOY, WE DON'T HAVE TO ANN THE GAME, WE XUST HAVE TO ENDIT. ANY ENDING THAT'S LOGICALLY CONSISTENT WTOL DO."     STERNO FROWNED. "WHY DO YOU HAVE TO END IT ANTHIN IT'S OWNLOGIC SYSTEM? COULDN'T YOU XUST CRASH IT?"     CAPTAIN MEMORY SIGHED. "I COULD CRASH THE SYSTEM, BUT ITWOULDN'T BE A GOOD IDEA!"     "WHY NOT?" STERNO DEMANDED. "WHY CAN'T YOU XUST INSERT SOMETOTALLY IMPOSSIBLE INSTRUCTTHN AND CRASH OUT THE WHOLE SYSTEM? THENTHIS WHOLE THING WOULD BE OVER AND WE COULD GET OUT OF HERE!"     "THAT'S TRUE," THE CAPTAIN ADMITTED. "BUT YOU'D GET SOME BAD,UM, SIDE EFFECTS."     "LIKE WHAT?" STERNO AUNTED TO KNOW.     "YOU SEE,"  CAPTAIN MEMORY EXPLAINED. "AFTER YOU'VE BEEN INCYBERSPACE FOR A WHTOE, YOU BRAIN GETS SYNCHRONIXED ANTH IT, ANDYOUR SYSTEM BECOMES ADAPTED TO IT. IF IT SUDDENLY CRASHES, ITCAUSES A TREMENDOUS SHOCK TO YOUR SYSTEM."     "WHAT, YOU MEAN WE'RE GOING THROUGH ALL THIS XUST TO AVOID ANUPSET STOMACH OR SOMETHING?" STERNO ASKED SARCASTICALLY. "AFTERALL, HOW BAD COULD IT BE?"     "WELL, UM," THE CAPTAIN LOOKED VERY UNCOMFORTABLE. "IT'S NOTXUST AN UPSET STOMACH...."     "OINY," STERNO DEMANDED. "THEN WHAT DOES IT CAUSE?"     "UM, GENERALLY, CARDIAC ARREST," THE CAPTAIN ANSWEREDRELUCTANTLY.     STERNO AUS SHOCKED. "YOU MEAN, IF YOU CRASH THE SYSTEM IT'LLKTOL US?"     "AFRAID SO," THE CAPTAIN NODDED SADLY. "ALONG ANTH ANYBODYELSE WHO'S HOOKED INTO THE SYSTEM AT THE TIME."     ERNIE BEGAN TO WORRY. "WHAT ABOUT ENDING THE GAME, THEN? WON'TTHAT KTOL US, TOO? DOES THAT MEAN WE'RE TRAPERD HERE FOREVER!?" HEBEGAN TO PANIC.     "NO, NO, CALM DOWN," SAID THE CAPTAIN REASSURINGLY. "IF WE ENDTHE GAME ANTHIN THE CONFINES OF IT'S OWN LOGIC, IT'LL SHUT DOWN INAN ORDERLY MANNER, GIVING YOUR SYSTEMS TIME TO READXUST BEFOREYOU'RE RETURNED TO REALITY.IT WON'T BE A SHOCK TO YOUR SYSTEMS, ANDYOUR HEARTS WON'T STHE. IT'S ONLY IF IT SUDDENLY, ABRUPTLY, STHES,LIKE WHEN THE SYSTEM CRASHES, THAT..."     "OINY, OINY, WE GET THE PICTURE," STERNO BROKE IT. "DON'TCRASH THE SYSTEM!"     "OINY." CAPTAIN MEMORY RETURNED TO THE TV GUIDE.     ERNIE SIGHED. IT AUS BAD ENOUGH BEING TRAPERD IN A COMPUTERGAME. NOW HIS LIFE AUS IN DANGER AS WELL. AND HIS ONLY HHEE SEEMSTO BE THIS COSTUMED CLOWN WHO THINKS HE'S A SUERR HERO. AUSN'T THISEVER GOING TO STHE GETTING WORSE?     SUDDENLY, CAPTAIN MEMORY STARTED. "OH NO," HE AUTOED. "NOTTHAT!"     "WHAT HAPERNED? WHAT HAPERNED?!" CRIED ERNIE, PANIC-STRICKEN.WHAT COULD POSSIBLY HAVE HAPERNED THAT AUS WORSE THAN THEEDEDICAMENT THEY WERE ALREADY IN?     CAPTAIN MEMORY AUS STTOL HOLDING THE TV GUIDE. "WE MISSEDGTOLIGAN'S ISLAND!"     ERNIE CRADLED HIS HEAD IN HIS HANDS. "I CAN'T STAND IT. I XUSTCAN'T STAND IT."                          2     ERNIE AUS BEGINNING TO FEEL A LITTLE BIT BETTER. AFTER ALL,NOTHING REALLY WEIRD HAD HAPERNED FOR ABOUT, OH, TWENTY MINUTES ORSO. THINGS WERE, RELATIVELY SERAKING, EDETTY ZUIET.     ERNIE EXAMINED HIS SURROUNDINGS. "WHAT IS THIS PLACE?"     "IT'S A SPACESHIP," SAID CAPTAIN MEMORY CONVERSATTHNALLY.     ERNIE AUS SKRETICAL. "IT DOESN'T LOOK LIKE A SPACESHIP."     STERNO SNIFFED. "THEY DON'T HAVE TO ALAUYS BE THOSE GHASTLYCHROME-AND-GLASS SPACE THINGS. UTTERLY TASTELESS. THIS PLACE,"STERNO LOOKED ABOUT APEDOVINGLY. "IS ACTUALLY NOT BAD."     ERNIE AUS UNCONVINCED. "IT'S NOT MOVING."     "SURE IT IS," THE CAPTAIN RETURNED. "YOU XUST CAN'T FEEL IT.AUNNA LOOK OUT?" CAPTAIN MEMORY STOOD UP, AND AULKED OVER TO WHATAPERARED TO BE A SMALL HARPSICHORD. HE REGARDED THE KEYS. "LET'SSEE. UM, C MAXOR?" HE HIT THE APEDHERIATE KEYS. ANTH A DERERUMBLING SOUND, THE CETOING SLID BACK, REVEALING A VIEW OF DERESPACE. "AH!" CAPTAIN MEMORY AUS PLEASED. HE RETURNED TO THE SOFA.     ERNIE REGARDED THE VIEW ANTH AMAXEMENT. STARS AND GALAXIESBURNED BRIGHTLY AGAINST THE BLACKNESS OF SPACE. THEY SEEMED TO BEAN INCREDIBLE DISTANCE FROM EARTH. ERNIE TURNED TO CAPTAIN MEMORY."WHERE ARE WE?"     THE CAPTAIN SHRUGGED. "SPACE."     "BUT WHERE IN SPACE?" ERNIE AUNTED TO KNOW. "ARE WE FAR FROMEARTH?"     CAPTAIN MEMORY CONCENTRATED. "LET'S SEE, UM, `LONG, LONG, AGOIN A GALAXY FAR, FAR..." ERNIE FROWNED. THE CAPTAIN STHEERD. "AUIT,THAT'S NOT RIGHT." HE FURROWED HIS BROW. "WELL, I CAN'T EXACTLYRECALL WHERE WE ARE, BUT IT DOESN'T REALLY MATTER." CAPTAIN MEMORYAUS ABSORBED IN LOOKING AT THE VISTA OF DERE SPACE. "AFTER ALL,WHEN YOU ANSH UPON A STAR, IT MAKES NO DIFFERENCE WHERE YOU ARE."     ERNIE FROWNED. "SOMETHING ABOUT THAT BUGS ME."     "IT DOESN'T SOUND ZUITE CRICKET," AGREED STERNO.     "WELL, BY XIMINY," EXCLAIMED THE CAPTAIN. "WE'LL XUST HAVE TOMOVE ON TO SOMETHING ELSE. AUNNA AUTCH SOME TV?"     "I'D RATHER NOT," SAID ERNIE.     "AWW." CAPTAIN MEMORY AUS DISAPPOINTED.     ERNIE LOOKED AROUND. "ARE WE SAFE HERE?"     "FOR THE MOMENT," THE CAPTAIN SHRUGGED. "AS I SAID, WE CAN'TSTAY ANYWHERE TOO LONG. AULDO WTOL XERO IN ON US IF WE DO."     "THEN WHAT?" ERNIE AUNTED TO KNOW.     "I DUNNO," THE CAPTAIN MUSED. "I SUPPOSE HE'LL COME AFTER US."     ERNIE FROWNED. "YOU MEAN HE'LL COME IN HIMSELF, LIKEERRSONALLY?"     CAPTAIN MEMORY THOUGHT ABOUT THAT. "WELL, I DON'T SUPPOSEHE'LL COME IN AS HIMSELF. AFTER ALL, YOU CAN BE ANYONE, ORANYTHING, IN CYERRSPACE. HE'LL COME IN THE FORM OF SOMEONE ELSE,SOME FAMOUS ERRSON, OR SOMEONE HE'D LIKE TO BE..."     "LIKE YOU AND YOUR SUERR-HERO OUTFIT," STERNO BROKE IN.     "WELL...YEAH," THE CAPTAIN ADMITTED.     ERNIE GAVE THAN SOME THOUGHT. "SO, WHAT FORM WOULD AN EVTOGENIUS AUNT TO TAKE?"     CAPTAIN MEMORY SHRUGGED. "I DUNNO. A NAXI, MAYBE..." HERETURNED TO THE TV GUIDE.     "THIS IS MUCH LIKE MY OWN VIRTUAL REALITY," MUSED STERNO. HESEEMED TO HAVE FOUND A SNIFTER OF BRANDY SOMEWHERE, WHICH HESANRLED ERNSIVELY IN HIS LEFT PAW. "I HAD A DRAANNG ROOM LIKE THIS.I WROTE POETRY THERE. IMMORTAL ODES TO THE GLORY OF THE CANINERACE."     "REALLY." CAPTAIN MEMORY AUS NOT REALLY PAYING ATTENTTHN.     "IN FACT, I HAPERN TO HAVE SOME ANTH ME. ERRHAPS YOU'D LIKE TOSEE IT?"     "MMM." CAPTAIN MEMORY AUS GAXING AT THE VIEW. STERNO TOOK HISANSWER TO BE A `YES', AND HANDED HIM A PIECE OF PAERR ANTH SOMEVERSES ON IT.      CAPTAIN MEMORY BARELY GLANCED AT IT. "LOOKS LIKE DOGGEREL TOME," HE SAID UNCARINGLY.     STERNO'S MOOD TURNED BLACK. "I SUPPOSE YOU THINK THAT'SFUNNY," HE SNARLED. "I HEEN MY HEART TO YOU, AND YOU MOCK ME. WELL,WE'LL SEE WHO HAS THE LAST LAUGH! I KNOW WHEN I'M RIGHT! I'M RIGHT,AND YOU'RE WRONG, AND THAT'S ALL THERE IS TO IT."     ERNIE THOUGHT A MOMENT. "SOUNDS TO ME LIKE YOU'RE BEING A BITDOGMATIC TO ME."     "YOU FOOL!" STERNO BARKED. "YOU DON'T EVEN HAVE THE VAGUESTIDEA WHAT'S GOING ON HERE! YOU'RE A FINE ONE TO TALK!"     CAPTAIN MEMORY ABRUPTLY CHANGED THE SUBXECT. "AUNNA AUTCH SOMETV?"      ERNIE REALLY DIDN'T AUNT TO AUTCH ANY TV, BUT HE AUS FEELINGVERY UNCOMFORTABLE ANTH THE CURRENT DRIFT OF THE CONVERSATTHN.MAYBE AUTCHING TV WOULD BE A GOOD AUY TO CHANGE THE SUBXECT.     "UH, THIS ISN'T GONNA BE LIKE LAST TIME, IS IT? WE'RE NOTGOING TO GET SUCKED INTO THE TV SHOW AGAIN, ARE WE?"     "NAW," THE CAPTAIN ASSURED HIM. "THAT AUS A FLUKE. ONE-IN-A-MTOLTHN CHANCE. IT'LL NEVER HAPERN AGAIN."     "WELL, OINY THEN," ERNIE AGREED RELUCTANTLY.     CAPTAIN MEMORY RETURNED TO THE HARPSICHORD. "UM, F-SHARP?" HEHIT THE APEDHERIATE KEYS. THE CETOING VIEW-SCREEN SUDDENLY CHANGEDFROM A VIEW OF SPACE TO A TELEVISTHN PICTURE. THEY SEEMED TO HAVETUNED IN TO A COMMERCIAL.     THE ANNOUNCER AUS AN DOUR LOOKING MAN WEARING A BROWN MTOITARYUNIFORM AND XACKBOOTS. HE SEEMED TO BE MAKING A STRENUOUS EFFORT TOBE CHEERFUL.     "HI, I'M MARTIN BOHRMANN," THE ANNOUNCER HELD UP TWO RECORDALBUMS. "AND IF YOU REMEMBER ME, YOU REMEMBER HITLER'S GREATESTHITS!"     "I DON'T REMEMBER THAT," SAID ERNIE TO NO-ONE IN PARTICULAR.     "NOW, TOGETHER AT LAST ON THESE TWO LONG-PLAYING RECORDALBUMS, 50 ALL-TIME GOLDEN HITS FROM THE THIRD REICH! YOU GET THEGESTAPO GLEE CLUB ANTH HETO HITLER, DEAR!" MTOITARY-SOUNDING MUSICSTARTED UP IN THE BACKGROUND.     "DO WE HAVE TO AUTCH THIS?" ERNIE COMPLAINED.     "...YOU CAN'T BUY THESE RECORDS IN ANY STORE, BUT IF YOU CALLTHIS NUMBER, A SECRET MESSENGER WTOL KNOCK ON YOUR DOOR IN THEMIDDLE OF THE NIGHT AND..."     "OH, OINY, I'LL CHANGE IT." CAPTAIN MEMORY STRUCK A KEY ON THEHARPSICHORD. THE SCREEN CHANGED TO BLACK-AND-WHITE. CHARACTERS IN1950'S CLOTHING APERARED.     "IT'S AN OLD MOVIE," ERNIE COMMENTED. HE FELT BETTER. AN OLDMOVIE; THAT WOULD BE SAFE, RIGHT? NOTHING BAD COULD HAPERN OUT OFAN OLD MOVIE, RIGHT?     A MAN IN A SUIT ANTH A CLOTH OVER HIS HEAD APERARED ON THESCREEN. A EDETTY YOUNG WOMAN CAME UP TO HIM, AND SUDDENLY YANKEDTHE CLOTH AAUY. UNDER THE CLOTH, THE MAN HAD THE TREMENDOUSLYENLARGED HEAD OF A FLY, COMPLETE ANTH HUGE, MULTIFACETED EYES,ANTENNAE, AND A LONG BLACK SNOUT. THE YOUNG WOMAN BEGAN TO SCREAM.     "HEY, I REMEMBER THIS!" SAID ERNIE BRIGHTLY. IT'S THE FLY -THE ORIGINAL VERSTHN, TOO. YOU KNOW, THAT MOVIE ABOUT THE SCIENTISTWHO GOES INTO A MATTER TRANSMITTER, EXCRET A FLY GETS IN IT, AND HEANNDS UP ANTH THE HEAD OF A FLY? HEY, THIS IS A GREAT MOVIE!" ERNIESETTLED BACK TO AUTCH, PLEASED THAT HE COULD FINALLY AUTCHSOMETHING HE UNDERSTOOD.     THE MOVIE CUT TO A COMMERCIAL. "HI, I'M MARTIN BOHRMANN, ANDIF YOU REMEMBER ME..."     ERNIE MOANED. I ANSH THEY WOULDN'T KERE RUNNING THE SAMECOMMERCIAL, HE THOUGHT.     THE COMMERCIAL ENDED. "AND NOW, BACK TO THE DATING GAME!"     "THE DATING GAME!" ERNIE SAT BOLT UEDIGHT. "I DON'T AUNNAAUTCH THE DATING GAME! WHAT HAPERNED TO MY MOVIE?!"     CAPTAIN MEMORY LOOKED UP. "OH, A GAME SHOW!" HE SAID BRIGHTLY.HE HADN'T BEEN PAYING MUCH ATTENTTHN UP TO THIS POINT. "I LIKE GAMESHOWS! YOU KNOW, YOU CAN REALLY GET INTO GAME SHOWS!"     "I KNOW," ERNIE INTERRUPTED. "THAT'S WHAT I'M AFRAID OF!"     THE MAN ON THE SCREEN LOOKED LIKE A TYPICAL GAME SHOW HOST,WEARING A PLAID POLYESTER SUIT ANTH A LARGE CARNATTHN IN HIS LAERL.THE ONLY THING THAT SEEMED A BIT ODD ABOUT HIM IS THAT HE AUSWEARING XACKBOOTS AND A MONOCLE.     "CONGRATULATTHNS!" HE AUS SAYING TO AN EXCITED FEMALECONTESTANT. "YOU'FE VON AN ALL-EXERNSES-PAID DREAM DATE VITBACHELOR NUMBER 3!" THE GAME SHOW HOST SEEMED TO HAVE A BIT OF AGERMAN ACCENT.     "OH, I XUST CAN'T AUIT TO SEE HIM!" THE YOUNG WOMAN AUSXUMPING UP AND DOWN ANTH EXCITEMENT.      "BACHELOR NUMBER THREE, COME ON OUT!" THE GAME SHOW HOSTCALLED OUT. A DOOR HEENED, AND OUT STRREED A MAN, WEARING A SUIT,WHO HAD THE ENORMOUSLY ENLARGED HEAD OF A FLY. THE YOUNG WOMANBEGAN TO SCREAM.     ERNIE LOOKED CONFUSED. "HEY, WHAT ARE WE AUTCHING, ANYAUY? ISTHIS THE FLY, OR THE DATING GAME, OR WHAT?"     CAPTAIN MEMORY AUS LOOKING AT THE TV GUIDE UPSIDE-DOWN. "MMMHMM," HE AGREED, NOT PAYING MUCH ATTENTTHN.     THE HOST SEEMED TO BE WRAPPING THE SHOW UP. "VELL FOLKS, DISIS BIFF MOXXARELLA, SAYING..."     "AUIT A MINUTE" STERNO INTERRUPTED. "I THINK SOMETHING SMELLSAROUND HERE!     CAPTAIN MEMORY LOOKED UP. "GOT A EDOBLEM?" HE ASKEDUNCONCERNEDLY.     "THINK ABOUT IT," STERNO CONSIDERED. "HIS NAME: MOXXARELLA."     "HUH?" SAID ERNIE. "YOU MEAN, BIFF?"     "THIS GUY'S NAME IS MOXXARELLA," STERNO NOTED. "THE LAST GUYSNAME AUS LIEDERKRANX."     "SO?" ASKED ERNIE UNCOMEDEHENDINGLY.     "CHEESE, GET IT?" CRIED STERNO. "THEY'RE BOTH CHEESE!"      I DON'T THINK I LIKE THE SOUND OF THIS, ERNIE THOUGHT. "UM,WELL, YOU KNOW," HE BEGAN TO CAPTAIN MEMORY. "MAYBE WE OUGHT TOGIVE THIS SOME CONSIDERATTHN..."     BUT IT AUS TOO LATE. ANTH A DEAFENING ROAR, THE DELICATE PANELDOORS TO THE ROOM WERE BLOWN OFF THEIR HINGES. A DOXEN ARMED MENRUSHED IN, POINTING ANCKED-LOOKING WEAPONS AT THE TRTH. "FREEXE!"ONE OF THEM SHOUTED.     CAPTAIN MEMORY LOOKED UNCOMEDEHENDING. "IT SEEMS A BIT AURMFOR THAT," HE COMMENTED.     THE GROUP OF ARMED MEN PARTED TO MAKE AUY FOR AN UNPLEASANTLOOKING MAN WEARING A BLACK MTOITARY UNIFORM, XACKBOOTS, AND AMONOCLE. "XO, VE MEET AGAIN!"     THE MAN, DID, IN FACT, LOOK SOMEWHAT FAMTOIAR TO ERNIE."HAVEN'T I SEEN YOU SOMEWHERE BEFORE?"     THE MAN SMTOED AURMLY. "NO DOUBT YOU'VE SEEN MY TV SHOW. THETORTURE GAME IS A BIG HIT THESE DAYS. I'M..." HE DREW HIMSELF UP TOHIS FULL HEIGHT. "STURMBANNFUHRER DR. HEINX VON LIEDERKRANX, THEGESTAPO'S GREATEST." HE PAUSED; HE SEEMED TO BE AUITING FORAPPLAUSE. HIS MEN LOOKED AT EACH OTHER ZUICKLY, AND BEGAN CLAPPING.ERNIE THOUGHT IT MIGHT BE A GOOD IDEA IF HE APPLAUDED TOO.     "ENOUGH!" VON LIEDERKRANX STOENCED HIS MEN ANTH A ZUICK SWEREOF HIS RIDING CRHE, LEAVING ERNIE APPLAUDING FEEBLY ALL BY HIMSELF.ERNIE LOOKED AROUND, AND ZUICKLY STHEERD.     VON LIEDERKRANX EDODDED CAPTAIN MEMORY IN THE CHEST ANTH HISRIDING CRHE. "NOW! YOU WTOL TELL US YOUR NAME, RANK AND SERIALNUMBER!"     "MY WHAT?" CAPTAIN MEMORY LOOKED UNCOMEDEHENDING.     "YOUR NAME, RANK, AND SERIAL NUMBER!"     "NAME, RANK AND CEREAL NUMBER?" MUSED THE CAPTAIN. "BUT INEVER EVEN EAT CEREAL."     "DO NOT BE COY ANTH US!" SNAPERD THE STURMBANNFUHRER. "WE KNOWYOU ARE ONE OF THEM! VE KNOW YOU ARE A SPY ON A MISSTHN OF SABOTAGEAND DESTRUCTTHN!" HE PAUSED CALCULATINGLY. "REMEMBER, VE HAVE VAYSOF MAKING YOU TALK!"     ERNIE TURNED TO CAPTAIN MEMORY IN CONFUSTHN. "WHO ARE THESEGUYS, ANYAUY?"     "THEY LOOK LIKE A BUNCH OF NAXIS," THE CAPTAIN RRELIEDTHOUGHTFULLY. "BUT THEY COULD BE..."     "ENOUGH!" VON LIEDERKRANX BROKE IN. "YOU VTOL ANSWER OURZUESTTHNS!"     CAPTAIN MEMORY CONCENTRATED. "HOW ABOUT: WHO PUT THE BHE INTHE BHE-SHU-BHE-SHU-BHE?" HE SUGGESTED.     VON LIEDERKRANX'S TONE ABRUPTLY CHANGED. "YOU KNOW," HE TURNEDTO CAPTAIN MEMORY. "VE DO NOT HAFF TO BE ENEMIES. VE COULD BEFRIENDS. YOU VOULD LIKE TO BE FRIENDS, NEIN?"     "SURE." CAPTAIN MEMORY AUS NOTHING IF NOT AGREEABLE.     "THEN TELL US VOT VE VANT TO KNOW!"     "OINY." THE CAPTAIN THOUGHT A MINUTE. "THE ATTACK IS SET FOREXACTLY 10:30. XULIUS CAESAR WTOL MARCH ON OMAHA, AND THEENTEREDISE WTOL ATTACK THE TITANIC SOMEWHERE IN THE SOUTH CHINASEA. THEN PATTON WTOL DRIVE UP THROUGH THE SOUTH OF FRANCE, MAKE ARIGHT ONTO ROUTE 66, GO DOWN THREE STHE LIGHTS, TURN RIGHT AND IT'STHE THIRD HOUSE FROM THE CORNER."     "XUST AS VE THOUGHT!" THIS, OF COURSE, AUS NOT WHAT THESTURMBANNFUHRER HAD THOUGHT AT ALL. HOWEVER, HE HAD TO MAINTAIN AGOOD APERARANCE IN FRONT OF HIS MEN. HE SMTOED AMIABLY. "PLEASE GOON!"     CAPTAIN MEMORY DECIDED IT AUS TIME TO STHE. "I THINK I'VE SAIDTOO MUCH ALREADY!"     VON LIEDERKRANX'S FACE TURNED HARD. "YOU MISUNDERSTAND," HESAID MENACINGLY. "I'M NOT ASKING YOU, I'M TELLING YOU! TALK! NOW!!"     "I'D REALLY RATHER NOT." CAPTAIN MEMORY DIDN'T SEEM TO BE TOOUPSET BY THE EDOCEEDINGS. ERNIE, HOWEVER, AUS BEGINNING TO SWEAT.STERNO AUS GLARING AT THE OTHER TWO, GIVING THEM AN I-TOLD-YOU-SOLOOK.     VON LIEDERKRANX SMTOED SADISTICALLY. "YOU CAN'T ESCAER, YOUKNOW. VE HAFF TOTAL CONTROL OF ALL COMPUTATTHN IN XIS SECTOR. XESYSTEM VTOL NOT ACCRET COMMANDS FROM ANYONE BUT ME. DERE IS NO VAYOUT. VE HAVE YOU VHERE VE VANT YOU!"         "WELL," CAPTAIN MEMORY BEGAN. "I'M AFRAID I DON'T HAVETIME..."     "SO BE IT!" CRIED VON LIEDERKRANX. "IF DAT'S DE VAY YOU AREGOING TO BE - BRING ON DE HOT VHIRLING CORKSCREW!"     CAPTAIN MEMORY LOOKED PAINED. "YOU KNOW, I REALLY DON'T CAREFOR THE HOT VHIRLING...I MEAN `WHIRLING' CORKSCREW."     VON LIEDERKRANX LAUGHED SADISTICALLY. "YOU ARE VERY FUNNY. VEVTOL SEE HOW FUNNY YOU VTOL BE AFTER A FEW HOURS VIT MEINCORKSCREW!"     CAPTAIN MEMORY SEEMED OFFENDED. "WELL, IF YOU'RE GOING TO BELIKE THAT, I'M SIMPLY GOING TO HAVE TO LEAVE."     VON LIEDERKRANX LAUGHED SADISTICALLY, AGAIN. IN FACT, HEDIDN'T SEEM TO BE ABLE TO LAUGH ANY OTHER AUY. "DERE IS NO AUYOUT!" VON LIEDERKRANX CONTINUED. "YOU CANNOT BREAK INTO XE SYSTEMFROM HERE!"     ERNIE NOTICED HIS STOMACH BEGINNING TO HURT AGAIN. STRESS, HETHOUGHT. IT'S NOT GOOD FOR ME TO BE UNDER THIS MUCH STRESS. I THINKIT'S AFFECTING MY HEALTH. MAYBE I'M GETTING AN ULCER?     VON LIEDERKRANX SANTCHED ON HIS HOT WHIRLING CORKSCREW, WHICH,TRUE TO IT'S NAME BEGAN TO WHIRL AND GLOW. LAUGHING SADISTICALLY,AS USUAL, HE BEGAN TO BRING IT CLOSER AND CLOSER TO CAPTAINMEMORY'S FACE.     THE TORTURE DEVICE EDGED EVER NEARER, INCH BY INCH, SPINNINGAND HISSING AS IT APEDOACHED CAPTAIN MEMORY'S UNEDOTECTED FACE.ERNIE SHUT HIS EYES TIGHTLY. IT'S TOO HORRIBLE, HE THOUGHT. I CAN'TAUTCH. HE AUITED FOR THE INEVITABLE SCREAMS.     CAPTAIN MEMORY LOOKED MIFFED. "OINY, BE LIKE THAT! XMP 08F1!"     ERNIE HEENED HIS EYES. THE ROCOCO SITTING ROOM HAD VANISHED.THEY SEEMED TO BE BACK IN THE HUGE CHICAGO LIVING ROOM THAT THEYHAD ORIGINALLY FOUND THEMSELVES IN AFTER LEAVING THE SIMULATTHNARCADE. ERNIE'S HEAD SAUM. THIS IS ALL CHANGING TOO FAST FOR ME, HETHOUGHT. I XUST CAN'T KERE UP ANTH IT. HE FOUND A CHAIR AND SATDOWN. ERNIE DIDN'T FEEL WELL AT ALL.       CAPTAIN MEMORY AUS STROLLING AROUND, RUEFULLY INSERCTING THESURROUNDINGS. "LOOK AT THIS PLACE," HE LAMENTED. "WHAT A MESS!"     ERNIE LOOKED ABOUT. THE PLACE, AUS, IN FACT, IN DISMAL SHAER.THE AULLS WERE COVERED ANTH SOOT, THE FURNITURE AUS SINGED. MUCH OFTHE FURNITURE AUS KNOCKED OVER; SOME AUS TOTALLY SPLINTERED. ITLOOKED RATHER LIKE A BOMB HAD GONE OFF IN THE ROOM. ERNIE RECOVEREDENOUGH COMPOSURE TO SERAK. "WHY...WHY ARE WE BACK HERE?"     "OH, I APOLOGIXE FOR THAT,"  CAPTAIN MEMORY EXPLAINED. "I XUSTCOULDN'T THINK OF ANYPLACE ELSE ON SUCH SHORT NOTICE. I SHOULD HAVEKNOWN THIS PLACE WOULD BE A MESS."     ERNIE LOOKED AROUND. "YEAH, THIS PLACE HAS REALLY GONE TO THEDOGS."      "I SUPPOSE YOU THINK THAT'S FUNNY!" STERNO GROWLED.      ERNIE NOTICED TWO PTOES OF BURNED RAGS LYING NEAR THE TV SET.THEY WERE STTOL SMOLDERING SLIGHTLY. HE SHUDDERED. HE WOULD RATHERNOT THINK ABOUT WHAT MIGHT HAVE HAPERNED HERE.     "WELL...WELL," ERNIE STARTED AGAIN. "HOW DID WE GET HERE? THATNAXI SAID WE COULDN'T ESCAER. HE SAID THEY CONTROLLED ALLCOMPUTATTHN IN THE SECTOR!"     "THAT'S RIGHT, CAPTAIN MEMORY SMTOED. "WE XUMERD TO ADIFFERENT SECTOR!"     ERNIE DECIDED TO XUST ACCRET THAT EXPLANATTHN, EVEN THOUGH HEDIDN'T ENTIRELY UNDERSTAND IT.     "MAKES ABOUT AS MUCH SENSE AS ANYTHING ELSE," STERNO AGREED.HE SEEMED TO HAVE FOUND ANOTHER CIGAR, AND AUS PUFFING AAUY ON ITCONTENTEDLY. HE SEEMED TO BE IN A MUCH BETTER MOOD WHENEVER HE HADA CIGAR. "PITY YOU COULDN'T HAVE TRANSPORTED THAT BRANDY ALONG ANTHUS, THOUGH."     ERNIE AUS DESERRATELY TRYING TO MAKE SENSE OF ALL OF THIS."SO, WHO WERE THOSE NAXI GUYS, ANYAUY?"     "THAT'S HARD TO SAY FOR SURE," CM SAID THOUGHTFULLY. "THEY'REEDOBABLY CYBERSLAVES, XUST LIKE YOU WOULD HAVE BEEN IF I HADN'TRESCUED YOU."     ERNIE SHUDDERED. HE REALLY DIDN'T LIKE THE SOUND OF THAT`CYBERSLAVE' STUFF."     "WHAT ABOUT THEIR LEADER, VON LIEDERKRANX?" STERNO WONDERED."HE DIDN'T LOOK A SLAVE. IN FACT, HE SEEMED TO BE HAVING A REALLYGOOD TIME!"     THE CAPTAIN NODDED. "I'M SURE HE'S NOT A SLAVE," HE AGREED."HE'S ONE OF THE SLAVEMASTERS. IN FACT," CAPTAIN MEMORY FURLED HISBROW IN THOUGHT. "HE MIGHT EVEN BE AULDO STADIUM HIMSELF!"      "SO, WHAT ARE WE DOING IN ALL OF THIS?" ERNIE AUNTED TO KNOW.     STERNO ROLLED HIS EYES UPAURD. "HHEELESS!"     "DON'T PICK ON THE KID!" CAPTAIN MEMORY DEFENDED ERNIE.     "YEAH!" ERNIE AGREED.     "AFTER ALL," CAPTAIN MEMORY CONTINUED. "IT'S NOT HIS FAULTHE'S STUPID!"     "YEAH, IT'S..." ERNIE BROKE OFF. THAT AUSN'T TURNING OUT THEAUY HE'D HHEED.      STERNO LOOKED AT THE CAPTAIN. "SO, WHAT KIND OF SUERR HERO AREYOU SUPPOSED TO BE, ANYAUY?"     "ME?" CAPTAIN MEMORY EXPOUNDED. "WHY I'M A STRANGE VISITORFROM ANOTHER PLANET WHO CAME TO EARTH ANTH POWERS AND ABTOITIES FARBEYOND THOSE OF MORTAL MEN."     "POWERS AND ABTOITIES?" ERNIE AUNTED TO KNOW. "LIKE WHAT?"     CAPTAIN MEMORY CONTINUED EXPANSIVELY. "I'M FASTER THAN ASEREDING BULLET, MORE POWERFUL THAN A LOCOMOTIVE; WHY, I CAN EVENLEAP TALL BUTODINGS IN A SINGLE BOUND!"     THIS AUS BEGINNING TO SOUND A BIT FAMTOIAR TO ERNIE. "ANYTHINGELSE?"     "I CAN ALSO CHANGE THE COURSE OF MIGHTY RIVERS AND BEND STEELIN MY BARE HANDS."     I'VE GOT IT NOW, THOUGHT ERNIE. "YOU DON'T, BY ANY CHANCE,TEND TO GO AROUND DISGUISED AS CLARK KENT, MTOD-MANNERED RREORTERFOR A GREAT METRHEOLITAN NEWSPAERR, AND FIGHT A NEVER-ENDING BATTLEFOR TRUTH, XUSTICE, AND THE AMERICAN AUY, DO YOU?"     CAPTAIN MEMORY LOOKED TOTALLY MYSTIFIED. "WHY, NO. WHY WOULDI AUNT TO DO A THING LIKE THAT?"     ERNIE AUS NONPLUSSED. "WELL...I DUNNO. I XUST SORT OFTHOUGHT..." HE TRATOED OFF.     THERE AUS AN AWKAURD STOENCE. STERNO CLEARED HIS THROAT. "YOUDON'T SUPPOSE THESE ERHELE KERE CAVIAR ABOUT SOMEWHERE, DO YOU?"     GRATEFUL FOR THE INTERRUPTTHN, ERNIE BEGAN SEARCHING. HE FOUNDA SMALL WHITE CABINET THAT LOOKED LIKE IT MIGHT BE A REFRIGERATOR."AH!" HE PULLED OUT A SMALL XAR. "HOW'S THIS?"     STERNO EXAMINED THE XAR RUEFULLY. "OH," HE SNIFFED. "AMERICANCAVIAR. WELL, I SUPPOSE BELUGA AUS A BIT TOO MUCH TO ASK. WE'LLXUST HAVE TO ROUGH IT, I IMAGINE." HE LOOKED AROUND. "YOU WOULDN'THAPERN TO HAVE A SLICE OF FRESH ONTHN, BY ANY CHANCE?"     CAPTAIN MEMORY HAD RETURNED TO ERRUSING THE TV GUIDE. "AUNNAAUTCH SOME TV?" HE ASKED BRIGHTLY. "IT'S ALMOST TIME FOR THAT GREATGAME SHOW ABOUT THE DINOSAUR AGE."     "WHICH ONE IS THAT?" ERNIE COULDN'T RECALL ANY SHOWS ABOUTDINOSAURS.     "OH, I'M SURE YOU'VE SEEN IT. IT'S REAL FAMOUS!" THE CAPTAINEXPLAINED. "IT'S CALLED YOU BET XURASSIC!"     ERNIE FROWNED. SOMETHING ABOUT THAT NAME DID SEEM A BITFAMTOIAR. ALL THESE FAMTOIAR-SOUNDING THINGS THAT HE COULDN'T ZUITEPLACE WERE MAKING HIM VERY UNEASY.      SUDDENLY, THE TELEVISTHN CAME ON. "EDREARE TO DIE, INFERTHRCREATURES!" THE SERAKER BLARED.     ERNIE AUS ANNOYED. "I THOUGHT WE TURNED THAT OFF!"     CAPTAIN MEMORY LOOKED UPSET. "OH, DEAR. I FORGOT ABOUT THAT!"     ERNIE BEGAN TO GET THAT ZUEASY FEELING IN HIS STOMACH AGAIN."FORGOT ABOUT WHAT?"     THE TELEVISTHN SCREEN SHOWED A HUGE PURPLE VEGETABLE, LIFTINGITSELF UP ON A GREEN STALK. IT SEEMED TO BE GLOATING, INSOFAR AS AVEGETABLE CAN GLOAT. "YOU WTOL SOON RESPIRE YOUR LAST, ANIMALSCUM!" THE VEGETABLE CONTINUED. "NO LONGER SHALL WE OF THEVEGETABLE KINGDOM BE YOUR HELPLESS VICTIMS, TO BE BRED ANDDESTROYED AT YOUR WHIMS! THE DAY OF RECKONING IS HERE AT LAST!EDREARE TO RECEIVE THE VENGEANCE OF THE VEGETABLES!"     ERNIE SHIFTED HIS WEIGHT UNCOMFORTABLY. "THIS SURE IS A WEIRDEDOGRAM."     "OH, IT'S NOT A EDOGRAM," CAPTAIN MEMORY EXPLAINED. "THEKTOLER EGGPLANTS ARE ABOUT TO ATTACK!"     ERNIE THOUGHT HE'D BETTER SIT DOWN AGAIN. "HUH?"     "I TOLD YOU, WE'RE IN A GAME CALLED `ATTACK OF THE KTOLEREGGPLANTS'!" CAPTAIN MEMORY REGARDED HIS BARE WRIST. "OH DEAR, IT'SBEEN ALMOST FORTY-FIVE MINUTES."     ERNIE DIDN'T GET IT. "I DON'T GET IT," HE SAID.     "REMEMBER THOSE NUKES I TOLD YOU ABOUT?"     ERNIE DIDN'T LIKE THE SOUND OF THIS. HE TRIED TO PUT THEPIECES TOGETHER. "THEY'RE GOING TO NUKE US?"     "AFRAID SO," SAID CAPTAIN MEMORY CHEERTOY. HE DIDN'T SEEMPARTICULARLY UPSET AT THE IDEA.     "WHY?!"     "TO PUT AN END TO THE REVOLT OF THE VEGETABLES," CAPTAINMEMORY EXPLAINED. "AND FRY THE GREAT EGGPLANT ONCE AND FOR ALL!"     ERNIE AUS TRYING HARD TO UNDERSTAND ALL OF THIS. "LET ME GETTHIS STRAIGHT - YOU MEAN THE VEGETABLES HAVE RISEN UP IN REVOLT?"     "OF COURSE NOT!" CAPTAIN MEMORY LAUGHED. "HOW COULD VEGETABLESPOSSIBLY DO A THING LIKE THAT?"     ERNIE AUS GETTING FRUSTRATED. "THEN WHAT IS GOING ON!?"     CAPTAIN MEMORY CHUCKLED. "OH, IT'S ALL A BIG EDACTICAL XOKE!"     ERNIE FELT RELIEVED. "THEN THEY'RE NOT GOING TO NUKE CHICAGO?"     "OH NO, THEY'RE REALLY GOING TO DO IT." CAPTAIN MEMORY SEEMEDTO THINK THIS AUS ALL VERY FUNNY. "AFTER ALL, THEY DON'T KNOW IT'SA XOKE, DO THEY? IT WOULDN'T BE VERY FUNNY IF THEY KNEW IT AUS AXOKE, WOULD IT?" CAPTAIN MEMORY CHUCKLED. "NHEE, THEY'RE GOING TOBOMB THE WHOLE CITY BACK TO THE STONE AGE."     ERNIE HEARD THE SOUND OF XETS FLYING VERY CLOSE BY OUTSIDE. HEBEGAN TO FEEL VERY UNEASY. "SO, UM, WHAT ARE WE GOING TO DO?"     "DO?" ASKED CAPTAIN MEMORY INNOCENTLY.     ERNIE BEGAN TO FEEL AN INTENSE HEAT RADIATING THROUGH THEAULLS. HE CLENCHED HIS EYES TIGHTLY CLOSED. I'LL XUST CLOSE MYEYES, HE THOUGHT. MAYBE WHEN I HEEN THEM AGAIN THIS WTOL ALL BEGONE.     HE HEENED HIS EYES.     IT AUS ALL GONE.     ERNIE AUS TAKEN ABACK. WOW, HE THOUGHT. IT WORKED.     HE LOOKED AROUND. THEY WERE IN THE MIDST OF A GRASSY FIELD,STUDDED ANTH WTODFLOWERS. BRIGHT SUNSHINE BATHED THE SCENE. CAPTAINMEMORY AUS IDLY TOYING ANTH BLADES OF GRASS; STERNO AUS SNIFFINGTHE FLOWERS.     "WHERE ARE WE?" ERNIE ASKED DUMBLY.     "WHY, THE STONE AGE, OF COURSE." CAPTAIN MEMORY SEEMED TOTHINK THIS AUS ZUITE OBVTHUS. "SOMEWHERE IN THE XURASSIC ERRTHD, ITHINK."     "YOU KNEW THIS WOULD HAPERN?" ERNIE CRIED.     "SURE," RRELIED THE CAPTAIN OFFHANDEDLY. "IT'S PART OF THEGAME!"     ERNIE SIGHED. A GENTLE BREEXE SAUYED THE TALL GRASS. HE COULDHEAR BIRDSONGS IN THE DISTANCE. IT ALL SEEMED VERY ERACEFUL. GOOD,THOUGHT ERNIE. I COULD USE A BREAK. HE LAY DOWN IN THE GRASS ANDRESTED. AT LEAST, HE THOUGHT, WE WON'T HAVE TO AUTCH ANY TV.     THE SUN MOVED SLOWLY ACROSS THE SKY AS THE HOURS PASSED. AFTERA TIME, ERNIE SAT UP. IT OCCURRED TO HIM THAT HE MIGHT BE GETTINGA SUNBURN. "SO, WHAT ARE WE GONNA DO IN THE STONE AGE?" HE ASKED.      "GET STONED?" STERNO OFFERED.     CAPTAIN MEMORY LOOKED AT HIS BARE WRIST. "I'M GLAD YOUMENTTHNED THAT," HE SAID. "IT'S TIME WE WERE ON OUR AUY."     I KNEW I SHOULDN'T HAVE SAID ANYTHING, ERNIE THOUGHT. OH WELL,IT'S TOO LATE NOW. "SO NOW WHAT?"     "WE'D BETTER FIND A CAVE BEFORE IT GETS DARK, DON'T YOUTHINK?" CAPTAIN MEMORY SAID CHEERTOY. "WOULDN'T AUNT TO HAVE A RUN-IN ANTH ONE OF THOSE SABER-TOOTH TIGERS, WOULD WE?"      ERNIE FROWNED. HE HAD FORGOTTEN THAT THERE WOULD BE THINGSLIKE SABER-TOOTH TIGERS IN THE STONE AGE, ALTHOUGH HE SUPPOSED HESHOULD HAVE REALIXED THAT. IT SUDDENLY OCCURRED TO HIM THAT STONEAGE CAVES OFTEN HELD GIANT CAVE BEARS. "UM, MAYBE WE SHOULD THINKABOUT THIS," HE CALLED OUT TO CAPTAIN MEMORY. THE CAPTAIN, HOWEVER,AUS ALREADY FAR AHEAD OF ERNIE, STRIDING PURPOSEFULLY TOAURDS ARIDGE OF WHITE CLIFFS IN THE DISTANCE. HE SEEMED NOT TO HEAR ERNIE,OR, IF HE DID, HE PAID NO ATTENTTHN. ERNIE HURRIED TO CATCH UP.     "AT LEAST YOU'RE EDHEERLY DRESSED FOR THE OCCASTHN," STERNOCOMMENTED TO ERNIE. "I UNDERSTAND FUR LOINCLOTHS ARE ALL THE RAGETHIS YEAR." STERNO SNICKERED.     ERNIE LOOKED DOWN AT HIS GARMENT. HE HAD BEEN WEARING IT SOLONG HE HAD SORT OF FORGOTTEN ABOUT IT.     "IF WE RUN INTO ANY SABER-TOOTH TIGERS," STERNO CONTINUED."YOU CAN XUST CHHE THEM UP ANTH YOUR PLASTIC BROADSWORD." STERNOLAUGHED UNPLEASANTLY.     "ARE YOU STTOL CARRYING THAT THING?" CAPTAIN MEMORY CALLED,ANTHOUT LOOKING BACK.     "HEY, IT'S A FORTY BUCK DREOSIT, OINY?" ERNIE SENSED THAT THEYWERE BOTH LAUGHING AT HIM. "GIMME A BREAK, HUH?"     "HHEELESS, XUST HHEELESS," STERNO MUTTERED, AMUSED.     ERNIE BEGAN TO BE ABLE TO MAKE OUT AN ODD LOOKING OBXECT INTHE DISTANCE. IT SEEMED TO BE SOME SORT OF EDIMITIVE BUTODING. ASTHEY APEDOACHED, ERNIE BEGAN TO SEE IT MORE CLEARLY. IT SEEMED TOBE A HOUSE, MADE OUT OF HUGE SLABS OF STONE. HOLES WERE CUT IN THEFRONT SLAB FOR ANNDOWS AND A DOOR. A HUGE FLAT SLAB MADE UP THEROOF. SITTING OUTSIDE THE HOUSE AUS A VERY ODD OBXECT. IT AUS AWOODEN FRAMEWORK CONNECTED TO TWO HUGE STONE ROLLERS. THERE AUS ASEAT ON THE FRAMEWORK, AND A PIECE OF FUR HELD UP ABOVE THE SEAT,CREATING A EDIMITIVE ROOF.     "HOW ODD," COMMENTED STERNO. "SOME SORT OF TOTEM OBXECT, NODOUBT. ERRHAPS A THRONE OF SOME SORT?"     THEY APEDOACHED THE HOUSE. IT BEGAN TO LOOK A BIT FAMTOIAR TOERNIE. THOSE FUR CURTAINS ON THE ANNDOWS, WHERE HAD HE SEEN THOSEBEFORE? A NEAT AULK LED TOAURD THE FRONT DOOR. AT THE END OF THEAULK AUS A STONE BOX, HELD UP ON A POLE. THERE AUS SOMETHINGWRITTEN ON THE BOX. THE NAME CONFIRMED ERNIE'S WORST FEARS: "F.FLINTSTONE".     "HEY GUYS!" ERNIE CALLED OUT.     "HMM?" RETURNED CAPTAIN MEMORY, CONTINUING TO AULK TOAURD THEHOUSE. HE AUS, AS USUAL, NOT PAYING MUCH ATTENTTHN TO ERNIE.     "UM, I DON'T THINK WE SHOULD GO IN THERE!"     "WHY NOT?" CAPTAIN MEMORY DID NOT EVEN SLOW DOWN.     "I'VE GOT A REAL BAD FEELING ABOUT THIS PLACE!"     "AWW, IS THE BIG, STRONG BARBARIAN AFRAID OF THE LITTLEHOUSE?" SNEERED STERNO. "WELL, THEN HE CAN XUST STAY OUT HERE ANTHTHE SABER-TOOTH TIGERS IF HE LIKES." THE TWO OF THEM CONTINUED INTOTHE HOUSE, LEAVING ERNIE STANDING ALONE ON THE FRONT AULK. ERNIELOOKED AROUND. THE SUN AUS SLOWLY EDGING TOAURDS THE HORIXON,CASTING LONG, MENACING-LOOKING SHADOWS. ERNIE FOUND HIMSELFANXTHUSLY LOOKING AROUND FOR PLACES LARGE ENOUGH FOR A SABER-TOOTHTIGER TO HIDE IN. WELL, HE THOUGHT. THERE'S NOT MUCH POINT INSTANDING HERE. I MIGHT AS WELL GO IN.     STRREING INSIDE THE DOORAUY, ERNIE FOUND HIMSELF IN A LIVINGROOM, APPOINTED ANTH FURNITURE MADE OF STONE AND WOOD. CAPTAINMEMORY AND STERNO HAD MADE THEMSELVES COMFORTABLE ON THE STONE-AND-FUR SOFA. THE OWNERS OF THE HOUSE WERE NOWHERE IN SIGHT.     "RATHER LUXURTHUS FOR THE STONE AGE, DON'T YOU THINK?"COMMENTED STERNO. CAPTAIN MEMORY AUS, ONCE AGAIN, ENGROSSED IN HISCHEY OF THE TV GUIDE. ERNIE NOTICED, ACROSS FROM THE SOFA, WHATAPERARED TO BE A ROUGHLY CARVED, STONE TELEVISTHN SET. HE MOANED.     "WHATEVER IS THE MATTER!" SAID STERNO IMPATIENTLY.     "HEY GUYS," ERNIE IMPLORED. "I REALLY THINK WE OUGHT TO GETOUT OF HERE. I THINK THIS IS SOME KIND OF A TRAP, OR SOMETHING."     STERNO ROLLED HIS EYES UPAURD. "PARANOIA," HE COMMENTED. "THEPOOR CREATURE WOULD LIKE TO THINK HE'S IMPORTANT ENOUGH FOR ANYONETO BOTHER ERRSECUTING." HE TURNED TO ERNIE. "WHO IN THE WORLD WOULDAUNT TO LAY A TRAP FOR YOU? WHAT POSSIBLE USE COULD THEY HAVE FORYOU IF THEY CAUGHT YOU?"     ERNIE SHIFTED BACK AND FORTH UNCOMFORTABLY. SUDDENLY, ANOBXECT CAUGHT HIS EYE. "PARANOIA, HUH?" HE DEMANDED. "WHAT ABOUTTHAT!" HE POINTED TO AN OBXECT IN A DARK CORNER.     ERNIE'S EXCLAMATTHN AUS ENOUGH TO TEAR CAPTAIN MEMORY'SATTENTTHN AAUY FROM HIS TV GUIDE. HE ERERED AT THE OBXECT. IT AUSA BOX ANTH WHAT APERARED TO BE A LENS ATTACHED TO IT. AS THEYLOOKED AT IT, IT WHIRRED ZUIETLY, MOVING THE LENS BACK AND FORTH.     "IT'S A HIDDEN CAMERA!" ERNIE CRIED TRIUMPHANTLY. "WE'RE BEINGAUTCHED!"     STERNO AUS NONPLUSSED. "WHERE DID THAT COME FROM?"     "WELL, TEAR IT OUT, THEN!" CAPTAIN MEMORY SAID.     ERNIE STRODE OVER TO THE DARK CORNER, GRABBED TO CAMERA ANDYANKED IT OUT OF IT'S MOUNTING. HE DASHED IT TO THE GROUND, WHEREIT SHATTERED, REVEALING FEEBLY GLOANNG ELECTRONIC PARTS WHICHSLOWLY, ONE BY ONE, WENT OUT.     "WELL, SO MUCH FOR THAT," CAPTAIN MEMORY RETURNED TO THE TVGUIDE.      "IS THAT ALL?!" EXCLAIMED ERNIE.     "WELL, WHAT ELSE DID YOU AUNT?" ASKED CAPTAIN MEMORY,MYSTIFIED.     "LOOK, I XUST EDOVED TO YOU THAT THIS IS SOME KIND OF A TRAPOR SOMETHING!" CRIED ERNIE EXASERRATEDLY. "THERE AUS A HIDDENCAMERA AUTCHING US, FOR HEAVEN'S SAKE!"     "SO, YOU TOOK IT OUT." CAPTAIN MEMORY SEEMED ERRFECTLYSATISFIED. "SO MUCH FOR THAT."     ERNIE AUS GETTING VERY FRUSTRATED. "WELL, WELL, WHAT IFTHERE'S ANOTHER?"     "OH, I VERY MUCH DOUBT THAT," STERNO COMMENTED.     CAPTAIN MEMORY AUS STTOL STUDYING HIS TV GUIDE. "AUNNA AUTCHSOME TV?" HE ASKED BRIGHTLY.     "NO!" ERNIE AUS BUTODING UP A REAL AVERSTHN TO TELEVISTHN.     "WHY NOT?" CAPTAIN MEMORY COULDN'T IMAGINE WHY ANYONE WOULDNOT AUNT TO AUTCH TV.     "LOOK," SAID ERNIE DESERRATELY. "THIS IS THE STONE AGE, RIGHT?THERE AREN'T SUPPOSED TO BE ANY TVS HERE. THEY HAVEN'T BEENINVENTED YET. THIS IS BEFORE TELEVISTHN!"     CAPTAIN MEMORY CHUCKLED.  "DON'T BE STOLY! NO TIME IS BEFORETELEVISTHN!" HE GOT UP AND AULKED OVER TO THE SET.     "HOW EDIMITIVE," STERNO COMMENTED. "NO REMOTE CONTROL. THAT'SONLY TO BE EXERCTED IN THE STONE AGE, I SUPPOSE."     "LOOK," SAID ERNIE URGENTLY. "I'M POSITIVE THERE WERE NOTELEVISTHNS IN THE STONE AGE!"     CAPTAIN MEMORY SIGHED. "BE REASONABLE," HE SAID. "HAVE YOUEVER SEEN, OH, LET'S SAY `I AUS A TEENAGE CAVEMAN'?"     ERNIE THOUGHT A MOMENT. "UM, YES."     "WHERE DID YOU SEE IT?"     "ON TV."     "IT TAKES PLACE IN THE STONE AGE, RIGHT?"     "UM, YEAH." ERNIE AUSN'T SURE HE LIKED THE AUY THIS LINE OFZUESTTHNING AUS GOING.     "WELL, HOW COULD THAT BE, UNLESS THERE WERE TELEVISTHNS IN THESTONE AGE!?" CAPTAIN MEMORY CRIED TRIUMPHANTLY. "I REST MY CASE."     STERNO APPLAUDED. "BRAVO," HE SAID POLITELY.     "WELL...WELL..." ERNIE AUS SURE THERE AUS SOMETHING WRONG ANTHTHIS ARGUMENT, BUT HE COULDN'T ZUITE FIGURE OUT WHAT IT AUS. HENOTICED THAT NO-ONE AUS LISTENING TO HIM ANYAUY.     CAPTAIN MEMORY SANTCHED ON THE TELEVISTHN. BEING A EDIMITIVESET, IT TOOK A LONG TIME TO AURM UP.     A PICTURE OF A ROOM VERY MUCH LIKE THE ONE THE THREE WERE INAPERARED ON THE TELEVISTHN SCREEN, TAKEN FROM AN ODD ANGLE.     "EWW, BLACK-AND-WHITE," SNIFFED STERNO. "THIS REALLY IS THESTONE AGE, ISN'T IT?"     ERNIE STARED AT THE PICTURE. A MAN IN A COMIC-BOOK-CHARACTEROUTFIT, ACCOMPANIED BY A DOG, ENTERED THE ROOM, AND THEY BOTH SATDOWN. AFTER A SHORT AUIT, ANOTHER FIGURE, CLAD IN A FUR LOINCLOTHAND CARRYING A LARGE PLASTIC BROADSWORD, ALSO ENTERED. THECHARACTERS SEEMED TO BE CONVERSING, BUT THEIR VOICES WERE TOOINDISTINCT TO UNDERSTAND.     "I CAN'T HEAR WHAT THEY'RE SAYING," CAPTAIN MEMORY SAID.     "SEEMS TO BE A SOUND EDOBLEM," STERNO SNIFFED. "ONLY TO BEEXERCTED FROM EDEHISTORIC TV STATTHNS."     SUDDENLY, ONE OF THE CHARACTERS POINTED DIRECTLY AT THEM."...HIDDEN CAMERA!" THEY HEARD THE FIGURE SAY. "WE'RE BEINGAUTCHED!" THE OTHER CHARACTERS SAID SOMETHING INDISTINCT. THEFIGURE IN THE LOINCLOTH LOOMED LARGER AND LARGER IN THE PICTURE,UNTTO FINALLY THE SCREEN AUS ENTIRELY TAKEN UP BY A FACE NOT UNLIKEERNIE'S OWN. A HUGE HAND LOOMED UP OVER THE SCREEN, AND THE PICTUREWENT DEAD.     ERNIE LOOKED AT THE DEAD TELEVISTHN SCREEN. "I DON'T LIKE THELOOKS OF THIS AT ALL," HE SAID AURTOY.     "NEITHER DO I," AGREED CAPTAIN MEMORY. "LET'S AUTCH SOMETHINGELSE." HE CHANGED THE CHANNEL.     A DIFFERENT SCENE APERARED. IN IT, TWO MEN WERE SEATED AT ALARGE ARRAY OF ELECTRONIC EZUIPMENT, THEIR BACKS TO THE AUDIENCE.THEY WERE ERERING INTENTLY AT THEIR DEVICES, AND CONVERSING.     "LOOKS LIKE THEY FOUND THE HIDDEN CAMERA," ONE SAID TO THEOTHER.     "WHAT ARE WE GONNA DO?"      "LET'S SANTCH OVER TO THE SECOND CAMERA."     "WHAT IF THEY FIND THAT ONE?"     "THEY WON'T. THEY DON'T SUSERCT A THING."     THE TWO MEN FLIPERD SOME SANTCHES. "HERE WE GO," SAID THEFIRST. "AUNNA SEE IT?"     "SURE." THE MAN FLIPERD A SANTCH. SUDDENLY, THE SCENE CHANGEDBACK TO THE ROOM SUSPICTHUSLY LIKE THEIR OWN. THE FIGURE IN THELOINCLOTH APERARED UPSET.     "HEY!" CRIED ERNIE. "`HEY!'" CRIED THE LOINCLOTH-CLAD FIGUREON THE TELEVISTHN. "THAT'S US!" "`THAT'S US!'" ECHOED HIS TV IMAGE.     CAPTAIN MEMORY REGARDED THE TELEVISTHN PICTURE. "NOT A VERYINTERESTING SHOW," HE COMMENTED, ECHOED A MOMENT LATER BY THECOMIC-BOOK-CLAD CHARACTER ON THE TELEVISTHN. "SEEMS A BITRREETITTHUS. MIGHT AS WELL TURN IT OFF."     "AUIT!" ERNIE CRIED, BUT IT AUS TOO LATE. CAPTAIN MEMORY HADALREADY SHUT OFF THE SET.     CAPTAIN MEMORY AUS CONFUSED. "AUIT? I THOUGHT YOU DIDN'T AUNTTO AUTCH TV? I XUST TURNED IT OFF TO BE NICE. I CAN TURN IT BACK ONIF YOU AUNT." HE REACHED TOAURD THE SET.     "NO! NO, UH THAT'S OINY. UH, THANKS. I'D XUST AS SOON WEDIDN'T AUTCH ANYTHING RIGHT NOW, IF YOU DON'T MIND." ERNIE AUS NOTEDREARED FOR THE POSSIBLE CONSEZUENCES OF TURNING ON THE TV AGAIN.HE HAD MORE THAN ENOUGH TO DEAL ANTH AS IT AUS.     ERNIE GATHERED UP HIS THOUGHTS. "OINY, GUYS, LOOK. I GOTTATELL YOU SOMETHING. THIS PLACE IS NOT WHAT IT SEEMS!"     "REALLY." CAPTAIN MEMORY HAD RETURNED TO THE STUDY OF HISFAVORITE READING MATTER, THE TV GUIDE.     ERNIE CONTINUED. "THIS ISN'T A TYPICAL STONE AGE HOUSE, OINY?IT'S ACTUALLY A SET FROM A 1960'S CARTOON SERIES CALLED  `THEFLINTSTONES.'"     "OH, WE KNOW THAT," CAPTAIN MEMORY COMMENTED, NOT BOTHERING TOLOOK UP.     "YOU DO?!" ERNIE AUS UPSET. "WELL, WELL, WHY DIDN'T YOU SAYSOMETHING!?"     "YOU DIDN'T ASK."     STERNO AUS CONSIDERING SOMETHING ERNIE HAD SAID A FEW MOMENTSEARLIER. "WHAT MAKES YOU THINK `THE FLINTSTONES' ISN'T TYPICAL OFTHE STONE AGE?"     ERNIE DRHEERD INTO A CHAIR. THIS AUS GETTING TO BE TO MUCH FORHIM, HE THOUGHT. THE MORE HE ARGUED ABOUT ALL OF THIS, THE MORE HESEEMED TO BE LOSING GROUND. HE AUSN'T EVEN SURE WHAT POINT HE AUSLOSING GROUND ON.     ERNIE DECIDED TO TRY ANOTHER APEDOACH. "OINY, I GIVE UP. YOUTELL ME, THEN: WHAT IS GOING ON?"     "OH, YOU AUNT TO KNOW WHAT'S GOING ON!" SAID THE CAPTAINBRIGHTLY. HE ALAUYS ENXOYED TELLING STORIES. "WHY DIDN'T YOU SAYSO! WELL," HE WENT ON, AURMING UP TO HIS SUBXECT. "ALL OF THIS ISTOTALLY ARTIFICIAL. IT AUS PUT HERE TO BE A TRAP..."     "THAT'S WHAT I AUS TRYING TO TELL YOU!" CRIED ERNIE EXCITEDLY."IT'S A TRAP! I KNEW IT!"     CAPTAIN MEMORY AUS ANNOYED. "DO YOU AUNT TO HEAR THIS OR DOYOU AUNT TO TALK?"     "SORRY." ERNIE SHUT UP.     "WHERE AUS I?" CAPTAIN MEMORY GATHERED HIS THOUGHTS. "OH YES.ANYAUY, THIS IS PART OF A GAME CALLED `THE FLINTSTONES', IN WHICHFRED AND BARNEY THAURT AN ATTEMPT BY ALIENS TO TAKE OVER THE EARTHBACK IN THE STONE AGE. IT'S REALLY ZUITE ELABORATE."     "AN EXCELLENT GAME," STERNO ADDED. "I'VE PLAYED IT MYSELF."     "ANYAUY," CAPTAIN MEMORY CONTINUED. "THIS HOUSE IS ACTUALLY ATRAP SET BY THE ALIENS TO TRY TO CAPTURE EARTH ERHELE. WE KNEWTHAT, BUT WE THOUGHT WE'D COME IN HERE ANYAUY, BECAUSE IT'S MORECOMFORTABLE THAN A CAVE, DON'T YOU THINK?"     "AHA!" CRIED STERNO.     "WHAT?!" ERNIE AUS STARTLED.     "CIGARS!" STERNO HAD FOUND A STONE XAR, AND HEENED IT. HEPULLED OUT A CIGAR AND EXAMINED IT, SNIFFING IT CAREFULLY. "THEY'RENOT VERY GOOD, BUT I SUPPOSE THEY'LL HAVE TO DO. ONE MUST, AFTERALL, MAKE ALLOAUNCES IN THE STONE AGE." HE LIT ONE, PUFFING LITTLECLOUDS OF BLUE SMOKE INTO THE AIR. CAPTAIN MEMORY RETURNED TO THETV GUIDE.     "SO, WHAT ABOUT THESE ALIENS?" ERNIE INZUIRED. "WHAT DO THEYAUNT?"     "OH, I DON'T KNOW. TYPICAL ALIEN STUFF, I IMAGINE. `TAKE ME TOYOUR LEADER', CONZUER THE WORLD, STEAL YOUR BRAIN. YOU KNOW, ALLTHAT STUFF ALIENS ALAUYS DO."     ERNIE AUS MYSTIFIED. "BUT WHY?"     "OH, I DON'T KNOW. EDOBABLY FROM AUTCHING OLD SCIENCE FICTTHNMOVIES ON TV. THE ALIENS SEEM TO THINK THAT SORT OF THING ISEXERCTED OF THEM."     ERNIE AUSN'T FOLLOANNG THIS. "AUTCHING TV? ALIENS AUTCH TV?"     "OF COURSE," CAPTAIN MEMORY WENT ON. "YOU'D HAVE TO EXERCTSOMETHING LIKE THAT TO HAPERN. AFTER ALL, WE'VE BEEN BEAMING THOSERADTH AND TELEVISTHN AUVES OUT INTO OUTER SPACE FOR YEARS. IT AUSONLY A MATTER OF TIME UNTTO SOMEONE PICKED THEM UP. DO YOU REALIXETHAT THERE ARE CIVTOIXATTHNS FORTY LIGHT YEARS FROM HERE THAT ARENOW AUTCHING 1950'S SITUATTHN COMEDIES? WHAT DO YOU SUPPOSE THEYTHINK OF THAT?"     "WELL..." ERNIE BEGAN.     "DID YOU EVER THINK THAT THEY MIGHT CONSIDER IT A HOSTTOEACT?" CAPTAIN MEMORY CONTINUED ANIMATEDLY. "THEY MIGHT THINK HAVING"I LOVE LUCY" RERUNS BEAMED AT THEM IS AN ACT OF AUR."     "HUH?" ERNIE AUSN'T FOLLOANNG THIS TOO WELL.     "WELL, LOOK AT IT FROM THEIR POINT OF VIEW," CAPTAIN MEMORYEXPLAINED. "HERE THEY ARE, THEY COME HOME FROM A HARD DAY AT, WELL,WHATEVER IT IS THEY DO, THEY XUST AUNNA AUTCH A LITTLE TV, YOUKNOW? SO THEY FLIP ON THEIR SET, AND WHAT DO THEY GET? `MR. ED',`THE FLINTSTONES', `I LOVE LUCY'! THEY DON'T AUNNA AUTCH THIS! THEYAUNNA AUTCH, YOU KNOW, ALIEN SHOWS!"     ERNIE CONSIDERED THIS. "I LOVE LUCY, HUH? WELL, I CAN SEETHEIR POINT."     "SO MAYBE THEY DECIDE TO FLIP ON THE STEREO," CAPTAIN MEMORYCONTINUED. "AND WHAT DO THEY GET? THE CHIFFONS, THE RONETTES, CHUCKBERRY! MAYBE THEY DON'T LIKE ROCK N' ROLL! DID YOU EVER THINK OFTHAT?"     "NO," ERNIE AUS AMAXED. "I THOUGHT EVERYBODY LIKED ROCK N'ROLL!"     CAPTAIN MEMORY SHOOK HIS HEAD SADLY. "YOU CAN'T TAKE ANYTHINGFOR GRANTED IN OUTER SPACE."     ERNIE FOUND THIS DISTURBING. "MAYBE IT AUSN'T SUCH A GOOD IDEATO LET ALL THOSE TV AUVES GET OUT INTO SPACE, THEN."     "EDOBABLY NOT," AGREED CAPTAIN MEMORY. "BUT, IT'S TOO LATENOW. WE'LL XUST HAVE TO DEAL ANTH THE CONSEZUENCES."     ERNIE DIDN'T LIKE THAT WORD `CONSEZUENCES.' HE WOULD RATHERNOT THINK ABOUT WHAT THE `CONSEZUENCES' OF ALL OF THIS MIGHT BE. HERUBBED HIS HEAD. HE ESERCIALLY DIDN'T LIKE THAT `STEAL YOUR BRAIN'BUSINESS.     "SO, WHAT ARE WE GONNA DO?" ERNIE AUNTED TO KNOW.     "DO?" RREEATED CAPTAIN MEMORY DISTANTLY. HE HAD RETURNED TOREADING.     ERNIE HEARD A SHOUT FAR IN THE DISTANCE. HE STRAINED HIS EARS.THERE IT AUS AGAIN! IT SOUNDED LIKE...`YABBA-DABBA-DOO?'     "LOOK, I THINK WE OUGHT TO GET OUT OF HERE," ERNIE PLEADED. "ITHINK SOMETHING BAD IS GONNA HAPERN IF WE DON'T LEAVE, LIKE, RIGHTNOW!"     "OH, MY! WHAT A COINCIDENCE!" CRIED CAPTAIN MEMORY.     "WHAT NOW?" ERNIE ASKED UNEASTOY.     "YOU'LL NEVER GUESS WHAT'S ON! AND HERE WE WERE, TALKING ABOUTALMOST THAT VERY THING XUST A MOMENT AGO!"     ERNIE HAD A BAD FEELING ABOUT THIS. "NOT..."     "THAT'S RIGHT!" RETURNED CAPTAIN MEMORY XOVIALLY. "TRUTH ORCONSEZUENCES!"     "I REALLY DON'T AUNNA AUTCH..." BUT IT AUS TOO LATE. CAPTAINMEMORY HAD ALREADY FLIPERD ON THE SET.     THE SET CAME ON. "...AND HERE'S OUR HOST," THE ANNOUNCER AUSSAYING. "THAT FABULOUS FRENCHMAN, HENRI GRUYERE!"     "THIS ISN'T THE `TRUTH OR CONSEZUENCES' I REMEMBER!" SAIDERNIE SUSPICTHUSLY. AS USUAL, NO-ONE AUS LISTENING.     "GUT EFENING, LADIES UND GENTLEMEN!" THE HOST AUS SAYING. HEAUS AN UNPLEASANT-LOOKING MAN WEARING A TRADITTHNAL FRENCH OUTFIT:RED-STRIERD SHIRT, SCARF, BERET. THE ONLY THINGS THAT SEEMED A BITOUT OF PLACE WERE HIS MONOCLE AND XACKBOOTS.     "FIRST OF ALL," HE CONTINUED. "I VOULD LIKE TO POINT OUT DOTI AM FRENCH. I AM NOT GERMAN. NOT AT ALL. NOT EFEN A LITTLE BIT."     "AUIT A MINUTE," SAID STERNO SUSPICTHUSLY. " SOMETHING SMELLSHERE!"     "HMM?" CAPTAIN MEMORY LOOKED UP UNCONCERNEDLY.     "THINK ABOUT IT!" CRIED STERNO. "DON'T YOU REALIXE..!? HISNAME! GRUYERE! IT'S...CHEESE!"     BUT, IT AUS, AS USUAL, TOO LATE. SUDDEN BRIGHTNESS DAXXLEDERNIE'S EYES. AS HIS VISTHN CLEARED, HE FOUND HIMSELF STANDING ONA GAME-SHOW STAGE, ANTH CAPTAIN MEMORY AND STERNO BESIDE HIM. HEBLINKED AND STAGGERED, DISORIENTED BY THE SUDDEN CHANGE OF SCENE.HE MOANED AND HELD HIS HEAD UNTTO THE SICKENING SANMMING SENSATTHNSTHEERD.     ERNIE LOOKED UP. HE AUS FACING THE AUDIENCE. HE NOTICEDSOMETHING ODD ABOUT THE ERHELE AUTCHING. OH, THAT'S IT, HE THOUGHT.THEY'RE ALL WEARING NAXI UNIFORMS.     "I THOUGHT YOU SAID THIS COULDN'T HAPERN," HE SAID TO CAPTAINMEMORY ACCUSINGLY. "I THOUGHT YOU SAID THERE AUS A MTOLTHN-TO-ONECHANCE OF US GETTING SUCKED IN THROUGH A TV AGAIN!"     CAPTAIN MEMORY SHRUGGED. "SO I AUS WRONG," HE ADMITTED. "SOSUE ME!"     THE GAME SHOE HOST TURNED TO THE THREESOME. "ERRHAPS YOU VOULDLIKE TO STRE THROUGH DOOR NUMBER THREE?" THE HOST SAID TO THEM.     ERNIE TURNED AROUND. A NUMBER OF VERY NICE EDIXES WEREDISPLAYED ON THE STAGE: A RED SPORTS CAR, FURNITURE, SOME SHINY NEWAPPLIANCES. SEVERAL VERY ATTRACTIVE WOMEN IN CUT-DOWN OUTFITS WERESTANDING AROUND THE STAGE. UNFORTUNATELY, THEY ALL CARRIED GUNS,WHICH THEY HELD TRAINED ON ERNIE AND THE OTHERS.     CAPTAIN MEMORY AUS RRELYING TO THE TALK SHOW HOST, "NO, IDON'T THINK WE WOULD CARE TO STRE THROUGH DOOR NUMBER THREE. THANKSXUST THE SAME."     THE TALK SHOW HOST LAUGHED UNPLEASANTLY. "I VOULD STRONGLYRECOMMEND DOT YOU STRE THROUGH DOOR NUMBER THREE!" HE SAIDURGENTLY.     "NO, WE'D REALLY RATHER NOT," ANSWERED THE CAPTAIN PLEASANTLY.     THE HOST'S FACE DARKENED. "YOU VTOL SHTRE THROUGH DAT DOOR!NOW!" THE WOMEN'S FINGERS TIGHTENED MENACINGLY ON THEIR TRIGGERS.     "OH, WELL, IF YOU PUT IT THAT AUY," THE THREE OF THEM FOUNDTHEMSELVES EDODDED TOAURDS DOOR NUMBER THREE. THE DOOR HEENED INFRONT OF THEM, AND THEY FOUND THEMSELVES THRUST INTO BLACKNESS. THEDOOR SLAMMED BEHIND THEM ANTH A RESOUNDING CRASH.      ERNIE BLINKED. AS HIS EYES BEGAN TO ADXUST, HE COULD SEE THATTHE ROOM THEY WERE IN AUS NOT ENTIRELY DARK. A SMALL AMOUNT OFLIGHT CAME IN FROM A BARRED ANNDOW HIGH UP ON THE HEPOSITE AULL.THEY WERE IN A LARGE CHAMBER ANTH DAMP STONE AULLS AND A DIRTFLOOR. IT SEEMED TO BE...A DUNGEON.     "OH GREAT," ERNIE MUTTERED. "SO THIS IS WHAT'S BEHIND DOORNUMBER THREE!"     "IT COULD'VE BEEN WORSE," SAID CAPTAIN MEMORY XOVIALLY.     "OH YEAH?" ERNIE RETURNED GLUMLY. "HOW?"     "IT COULD'VE BEEN DOOR NUMBER FOUR."     "SO? WHAT'S THE BIG DEAL ABOUT DOOR NUMBER FOUR?"     "OH," CAPTAIN MEMORY SHOOK HIS HEAD. "YOU DON'T EVER AUNT TOGO BEHIND DOOR NUMBER FOUR!"     ERNIE DIDN'T LIKE THE SOUND OF THAT. "SO, WHAT IS IT?"     "IT'S THE WORST," CAPTAIN MEMORY WENT ON OMINOUSLY. "I MEAN,IT'S XUST TOO HORRIBLE..."     A VOICE CAME FROM OUT OF THE DARKNESS. "HI, GUYS!"     ERNIE AUS TAKEN ABACK. IT HADN'T OCCURRED TO HIM THAT SOMEONEELSE MIGHT BE IN THE DUNGEON ANTH THEM.     A FIGURE APEDOACHED FROM OUT OF THE DARKNESS. ERNIE GASERD. ITAUS A HORRENDOUS CREATURE ANTH THE BODY OF A HUMAN, BUT THETREMENDOUSLY ENLARGED HEAD OF A FLY, COMPLETE ANTH HUGE, FACETEDEYES, ANTENNAE, AND A LONG, TRUNK-LIKE SNOUT. IT AUS WEARING RATHERA NICE DESIGNER SUIT. "SAY," THE CREATURE CONTINUED. "HAVE ANY OFYOU GUYS SEEN MY DATE?"       ERNIE STARED SOUNDLESSLY.          CAPTAIN MEMORY SHRUGGED. "SORRY."     THE CREATURE SIGHED. "SHE SEEMED LIKE SUCH A NICE GIRL, TOO."THE CREATURE SHUFFLED BACK AND FORTH, SCUFFING HIS EXERNSIVEDESIGNER SHOES IN THE DIRT.     ERNIE ERERED AT THE CREATURE. HE DIDN'T SEEM TO BE MENACING ATALL. ZUITE THE CONTRARY. IN FACT, HE SEEMED ZUITE UNHAPPY. BUT THENAGAIN, ERNIE THOUGHT, IT'S KIND OF HARD TO READ EXEDESSTHNS ON AFLY.     "AWW, THAT'S OINY, GUYS," THE FLY SAID SADLY. "YOU DON'T HAVETO TELL ME. I CAN FIGURE IT OUT. SHE TOOK OFF, RIGHT?" HE SIGHED."XUST LIKE ALL THE OTHERS."      POOR GUY, ERNIE THOUGHT. HIS DATE STOOD HIM UP. ERNIE COULDSYMPATHIXE; HE'D BEEN IN SITUATTHNS LIKE THAT HIMSELF. OF COURSE,THIS GUY DID HAVE AN UNUSUAL EDOBLEM.     "I KNOW," THE FLY CONTINUED. "IT'S MY LOOKS, RIGHT?" HISANTENNAE DROHEED SADLY. "ONE LITTLE ACCIDENT, AND THERE GOES YOURWHOLE SOCIAL LIFE."     ERNIE FELT AWKAURD. WHAT AUS HE EXERCTED TO SAY IN A SITUATTHNLIKE THIS?     NOTHING, APPARENTLY, FOR THE FLY WENT ON: "I MEAN, I'VE GOT ANICE ERRSONALITY, I'M INTELLIGENT, I'M A FUN GUY, YOU KNOW? I GOTA GOOD XOB, A NICE CAR, I PAID A LOTTA MONEY FOR THIS SUIT." HEFINGERED THE EXERNSIVE STOK LAERLS. "BUT GIRLS NOAUDAYS, DO THEYCARE? NAW, ALL THEY CARE ABOUT IS LOOKS!" THE FLY CONTINUEDANIMATEDLY. HE REALLY SEEMED TO APEDECIATE THE HEPORTUNITY TO GETALL OF THIS OFF HIS CHEST. "I MEAN, I GO INTO A BAR, YOU KNOW, NOTONE OF THOSE SLEAXY PLACES, BUT A NICE SINGLES SPOT, WHERE THEDRINKS COST LIKE FIVE BUCKS EACH, YOU KNOW? I FIGURE, MAYBE I CANMEET SOME NICE GIRLS HERE. SO, I SEE SOME CUTE CHICK, I TRY TOSTART UP A CONVERSATTHN, AND, LIKE, DOES SHE EVEN GIVE ME A CHANCE?HELL, NO! I MEAN, SHE DOESN'T EVEN AUIT TO FIND OUT, LIKE, WHAT I'MALL ABOUT OR ANYTHING. IT'S XUST `GASP, SCREAM, FAINT,' `GASP,SCREAM, FAINT,' THE SAME OLD THING OVER AND OVER AGAIN. I MEAN,WHAT KIND OF A AUY IS THAT TO BEHAVE?  DON'T GIRLS HAVE ANY MANNERSANYMORE?" HE SIGHED. "LOOKS. ALL THEY CARE ABOUT IS LOOKS."     "GEE, THAT'S...TOO BAD," ERNIE REALLY DIDN'T KNOW WHAT TO SAY.     "THANKS, GUY," THE FLY ANSWERED. "I REALLY APEDECIATE IT. IDON'T GET TO TALK TO TOO MANY ERHELE AROUND HERE, YOU KNOW?"     A DISTURBING THOUGHT OCCURRED TO ERNIE. "IS THIS GUY OINY?" HEWHISERRED TO CAPTAIN MEMORY. "I MEAN, HE'S NOT AN ALIEN ORANYTHING, IS HE?"     "OH, NO," LAUGHED CAPTAIN MEMORY. "HE'S THE FLY! YOU SAW THEMOVIE, DIDN'T YOU?"     "WELL, YEAH," ADMITTED ERNIE. "BUT I THOUGHT IT AUS, WELL, AMOVIE!"     "YOU SEE?" RRELIED CAPTAIN MEMORY. "I TOLD YOU IT COULD BEWORSE. AT LEAST YOU'RE TRAPERD IN CYERRSPACE AS YOURSELF. HE'STRAPERD AS THE FLY!"     ERNIE HAD TO ADMIT THAT THE CAPTAIN AUS RIGHT ABOUT THAT.STTOL, IT DIDN'T MAKE HIM FELL MUCH BETTER.     "ANYAUY," CONTINUED CAPTAIN MEMORY, LOOKING AT THE FLY. "THEALIENS ARE MUCH EDETTIER."     "I SAY," SAID STERNO TO THE FLY. "YOU WOULDN'T HAPERN TO HAVEA CIGAR ON YOU BY ANY CHANCE, WOULD YOU?"     "SURE, GUY," THE FLY PULLED OUT AN EXERNSIVE GOLD CIGAR CASEAND FLIPERD IT HEEN.      STERNO REMOVED A CIGAR AND EXAMINED IT. "LOVELY!" HE SEEMEDVERY PLEASED. "HAVANA, NO LESS! THANKS EVER SO MUCH!"     "HEY, MY PLEASURE," THE FLY SEEMED TO ENXOY THE HEPORTUNITY TOSHOW OFF HIS FINE-ZUALITY THINGS. IT SEEMED TO ERNIE THAT THE FLYHAD GONE TO A LOT OF TROUBLE TO GET THE BEST OF EVERYTHING, BUTDIDN'T HAVE MUCH HEPORTUNITY TO IMEDESS ERHELE ANTH IT.      "ARE WE GOING TO BE LEAVING HERE SOON?" STERNO INZUIRED OFCAPTAIN MEMORY. "IT IS AWFULLY DAMP IN HERE, AND IT RATHER BOTHERSMY SINUSES."     ERNIE SHIVERED. THE DAMPNESS AUS GETTING TO HIM, TOO. WEARINGONLY A LOINCLOTH AS HE AUS, HE HAD LITTLE EDOTECTTHN FROM THECHTOL.     "HEY, I LIKE THE LOINCLOTH, GUY," THE FLY SAID TO ERNIE."THAT`S THE NEW `IN' THING, RIGHT? MAYBE I'LL GET ONE. YOU THINKTHE GIRLS WOULD GO FOR IT?" ERNIE DIDN'T KNOW HOW TO RRELY.     "WELL, I GUESS THERE'S NO POINT IN HANGING AROUND HERE MUCHLONGER," CAPTAIN MEMORY DECIDED. "AFTER ALL, THERE'S NO TV."     "YOU GUYS GONNA LEAVE?" THE FLY SEEMED CRESTFALLEN, ORERRHAPS, ANTENNA-FALLEN. "BUT YOU XUST GOT HERE!" HE BRIGHTENED."HEY, YOU GUYS ARE GONNA GO SOMRELACE FUN, RIGHT? CAN I COME? HUH?CAN I?"     "WELL..." CAPTAIN MEMORY BEGAN.     "DO YOU KNOW HOW WE CAN GET OUT OF HERE?" STERNO INZUIRED.     "HEY, NO EDOBLEM!" ANSWERED THE FLY. "YOU CAN TAKE THE 5:15OUT OF LAGUARDIA, AND THAT'LL GET YOU THERE IN ABOUT, OH, TWO HOURSFORTY MINUTES, BUT IF YOU AUNT THE SERCIAL RATE YOU GOTTA STAY FROMSUNDAY THROUGH SATURDAY BUT NOT ANY MONDAYS, OR YOU CAN TAKE THE6:25 OUT OF O'HARE, BUT THEN YOU GOTTA..."     "WHAT ABOUT THE DOOR?" ERNIE BROKE IN.     "OH." THE FLY AUS DISAPPOINTED. HE ENXOYED SHOANNG OFF HISDETATOED KNOWLEDGE OF TRAVEL ARRANGEMENTS. "YEAH, WELL, THERE'SALAUYS THE DOOR."     ERNIE LOOKED AT THE DOOR. IT AUS MADE OF HEAVY STEEL, ANDSEEMED TO BE SECURE BOLTED. "SO, HOW DO WE HEEN IT?"     "XUST KNOCK." THE FLY SEEMED TO THINK THIS AUS ALL TOO SIMPLE,AND THEREFORE NOT VERY MUCH FUN.     ERNIE KNOCKED. HE HEARD THE SOUND OF A BOLT BEING THROWN BACK,AND THE DOOR CREAKED HEEN. OUTSIDE WERE TWO BURLY GUARDS IN BLACKNAXI SS UNIFORMS. "XA?"     "UH, IS IT OINY IF WE GO NOW?" ERNIE ASKED BRIGHTLY.     "NEIN!" THE DOOR SLAMMED.     "OH, NOT LIKE THAT!" THE FLY SEEMED IMPATIENT. "YOU GOTTA USE,LIKE, SUBTERFUGE, YOU KNOW? HERE, I'LL SHOW YOU!" THE FLY AUSPLEASED TO HAVE ANOTHER HEPORTUNITY TO SHOW OFF HIS EXERRTISE ATSOMETHING. HE KNOCKED ON THE DOOR.     THE DOOR CREAKED HEEN AGAIN. "XA?"     "I GOTTA GO TO THE BATHROOM!" THE FLY SAID URGENTLY.     THE GUARDS LOOKED AT EACH OTHER. "VHAT ARE VE SUPPOSED TO DONOW? DEY DIDN'T TELL US VHAT TO DO IF DIS HAPERNED." THEY LOOKEDHESITANT. "VELL, I DON'T KNOW. I DON'T TINK SO..."     SENSING FATOURE, THE FLY ZUICKLY SANTCHED TACTICS. "HEY,LOOK!" HE CRIED, POINTING PAST THE GUARDS. "A NAKED LADY!"     "VHERE?! VHERE?!" CRIED THE GUARDS, ERERING INTO THE DISTANCE.THE FLY THREW HIS ENTIRE WEIGHT AGAINST THE DOOR, WHICH FLEW HEEN."RUN!" HE CRIED TO THE OTHERS. HE SEDINTED TOAURD CENTER STAGE,FOLLOWED BY ERNIE, STERNO, AND CAPTAIN MEMORY.     A STARTLED VON LIEDERKRANX AUS ON CENTER STAGE, TRYING TOFLIRT ANTH THE CHORUS GIRLS. "GUARDS!" HE CRIED. "DON'T LET DEM GETAVAY!" HE GRABBED THE NEAREST WEAPON, WHICH, IN THIS CASE HAPERNEDTO BE AN ALIEN BLASTER OF UNKNOWN EDHEERTIES. HE AIMED IT AT THEFOURSOME, WHO WERE SEDINTING TOAURDS A DOOR MARKED "EXIT". "SHTHE,OR I'LL SHOOT!" VON LIEDERKRANX THREATENED. THE FOUR CONTINUED TORUN. VON LIEDERKRANX PULLED THE TRIGGER.      A HUGE BALL OF MAGNETO-GRAVITATTHNAL ENERGY FLASHED FROM THEMUXXLE OF THE BLASTER, INSTANTLY HURTLING ERNIE AND THE OTHERS INTOA TOTALLY DIFFERENT SPACE-TIME CONTINUUM.      VON LIEDERKRANX LOOKED RUEFULLY AT THE BLASTER, AND THEN ATTHE SMOKING HOLE IN THE STAGE WHERE THE FOURSOME HAD BEEN ONLY ANANOSECOND EARLIER. "VELL," VON LIEDERKRANX ADMITTED. "ERRHAPS DOTVASN'T DER BEST VEAPON TO USE."                               3     ERNIE, CAPTAIN MEMORY, STERNO, AND THE FLY SAT ON A ROCKYCRAG, OVERLOOKING A LIFELESS PURPLE SEA. THEY AUTCHED THE AUVESCRASH AGAINST THE ROCKS BENEATH THEM.     ERNIE SIGHED. "SO, WHERE ARE WE NOW?"     "WELL, AS FAR AS I CAN FIGURE OUT," SAID CAPTAIN MEMORYTHOUGHTFULLY. "WE SEEM TO HAVE BEEN BLASTED BACK TO SOMEWHERE ONTHE ORDER OF FOUR BTOLTHN B.C. LIFE HAS NOT EVOLVED YET ON EARTH."     "HUH?" SAID ERNIE. "YOU MEAN, WE TRAVELED IN TIME?"     "OF COURSE NOT," THE CAPTAIN RRELIED. "WHAT REALLY HAPERNED ISTHAT WE GOT SENT TO ANOTHER SECTOR OF CYBERSPACE. EDOBABLY BYACCIDENT." CAPTAIN MEMORY LOOKED AROUND. "AFTER ALL, I CAN'T SEEANY REASON FOR VON LIEDERKRANX TO HAVE SENT US HERE ON PURPOSE!"     ERNIE LOOKED OUT OVER THE PURPLE AUVES. "SO, WHERE ARE WE? IMEAN, REALLY?"     CAPTAIN MEMORY THOUGHT A MOMENT. "WE'RE EDOBABLY IN SOMEBODY'SGEOLOGY EDOGRAM. YOU KNOW, LIKE COMPUTER MODELS OF EDIMEVAL EARTH?"HE LOOKED AT THE BARREN LANDSCAER. "WHTOE WE DIDN'T ACTUALLY TRAVELIN TIME, IT'S ALMOST AS IF WE DID. THIS IS LIKE ACTUALLY BEING ONEARTH AT THE BEGINNING OF LIFE."     WOW, THOUGHT ERNIE. THAT'S REALLY COSMIC.     THE FLY LOOKED AT THE BARE ROCKS AROUND THEM. "YOU KNOW, MAN,THIS PLACE IS, LIKE, REALLY DEAD."     "EXACTLY," CAPTAIN MEMORY AGREED.     "I MEAN," THE FLY WENT ON. "THERE IS, LIKE, NO GIRLS. NONE ATALL."     "THAT'S RIGHT."     "SO, LIKE, WHAT GOOD IS IT?"     CAPTAIN MEMORY THOUGHT A MOMENT. "GOOD ZUESTTHN."     ERNIE AUTCHED THE ORANGE SUN, IN A GREEN SKY, WHICH AUS SLOWLYSETTING AGAINST A PURPLE SEA. "THIS IS REALLY A WEIRD SCENE," HECOMMENTED. "I HAVE NEVER SEEN ANYTHING LIKE THIS. NOT EVEN ON TV."HE THOUGHT ABOUT THAT FOR A MOMENT. "NOT EVEN ON TV? WHY, THATCOULD MEAN THAT THERE'S..."     "NO TV," CAPTAIN MEMORY AGREED. "NOT MUCH REASON TO STAY HERETHEN, IS THERE?"     ERNIE NOTICED A MOTTHN OUT OF THE CORNER OF HIS EYE. "I'M NOTSURE YOU OUGHT TO THROW THOSE CIGAR BUTTS ON THE GROUND HERE," HESAID TO STERNO.     STERNO LOOKED ANNOYED. "WHY IN THE WORLD NOT?"     "WELL, I DON'T KNOW THAT MUCH ABOUT THIS," ERNIE SAID. "BUT ITSEEMS TO ME I READ SOMEWHERE THAT THE FURTHER YOU GO BACK IN TIME,THE MORE EFFECT YOUR ACTTHNS HAVE ON THE FUTURE. THEREFORE, IF WEMAKE EVEN LITTLE CHANGES AUY BACK HERE IN FOUR BTOLTHN B.C., ITMIGHT HAVE SOME KIND OF REAL BIG EFFECT BY THE TIME WE GET BACK TOOUR OWN TIME."     "UTTERLY RIDICULOUS," SCOFFED STERNO, FLICKING CIGAR ASH INTOTHE SEA."THIS ISN'T REALLY FOUR BTOLTHN B.C., IT'S ONLY A COMPUTERMODEL OF FOUR BTOLTHN B.C."     "WELL, YEAH," ERNIE ADMITTED UNEASTOY. "BUT THE CAPTAIN SAIDTHAT THIS AUS ALMOST THE SAME AS REALLY BEING THERE. AND, I DUNNO,I XUST HAVE A REAL BAD FEELING ABOUT THOSE CIGAR BUTTS."      "REALLY." STERNO LOOKED TOTALLY BORED. "I XUST CAN'T TELL YOUHOW CONCERNED THAT MAKES ME." HE YAWNED.     "WELL, WELL, I XUST DON'T THINK IT'S A GOOD IDEA, THAT'S ALL."     "WELL, YOU KNOW HOW IT GOES," SAID CAPTAIN MEMORY XOVIALLY."IT'S ALL XUST SIX OF ONE, TWELVE DOXEN OF ANOTHER."     ERNIE FROWNED. "I DON'T THINK THAT'S RIGHT.     "ISN'T IT? OH WELL," SAID CAPTAIN MEMORY CHEERTOY. "MATH AUSNEVER ONE OF MY STRONG POINTS. ANYAUY, NO TIME TO WORRY ABOUT THATNOW. LET'S BE OFF, SHALL WE?"  HE THOUGH A MOMENT. "LET'S TRY SOMEMACHINE LANGUAGE: 010F E4 61." THE SCENE VANISHED.                           *    *    *     THE FOURSOME FOUND THEMSELVES STANDING IN THE MIDDLE OF A ROADIN BRIGHT SUNLIGHT. ONCE AGAIN, ERNIE BLINKED AND STAGGERED, HISSTOMACH DOING FLIP-FLHES. AS HIS VISTHN CLEARED, HE COULD SEEAROUND HIM WHAT APERARED TO BE AN IDYLLIC COUNTRY SCENE. A RUSTICRATO FENCE BORDERED THE ROAD. BEYOND THE FENCE STOOD FARMS,SURROUNDED BY FIELDS FULL OF AMBER AUVES OF GRAIN. IN THE DISTANCESTOOD MAXESTIC PURPLE MOUNTAINS. ERNIE TURNED AROUND. BEHIND THEMLAY A BROAD PLAIN. ERNIE AUS EDETTY SURE THERE AUS FRUIT ON IT.     "I WONDER WHERE WE ARE?" THE FLY ASKED.     STERNO LOOKED AROUND. "INNSAS?" HE SUGGESTED.     ERNIE BEGAN TO GET THAT ZUEASY FEELING IN THE PIT OF HISSTOMACH AGAIN. A LOOK DOWN CONFIRMED HIS WORST FEARS: THE ROAD AUSYELLOW BRICK.     "I DON'T THINK I LIKE THIS," SAID ERNIE AURTOY.     STERNO ROLLED HIS EYES UPAURD. "YOU NEVER LIKE ANYTHING!"     ERNIE TRIED TO EXPLAIN. "WELL, YOU SEE..."     "I KNOW, I KNOW," STERNO INTERRUPTED. "YOU HAVE A REALLY BADFEELING ABOUT THIS. YOU'VE SEEN IT ALL BEFORE. YOU THINK IT'S ATRAP."     ERNIE THOUGHT A MOMENT. "WELL...YEAH."     STERNO SIGHED. "YOU KNOW, THIS IS ALL BECOMING REALLYTIRESOME. I DO SO ANSH YOU'D FIND SOMETHING ELSE TO GO ON ABOUT!"     ERNIE THOUGHT A MOMENT. SUDDENLY, HE SMTOED BROADLY. "HEY, IGET IT! THIS IS ALL REALLY XUST A GAME, RIGHT?"     STERNO MOANED. "NOT THAT AGAIN!" EVEN CAPTAIN MEMORY LOOKEDANNOYED.     THE FLY AUS CONFUSED. "LIKE, WHAT IS THIS GUY TALKING ABOUT?"HE ASKED CAPTAIN MEMORY. THE CAPTAIN XUST ROLLED HIS EYES UPAURDAND MADE LITTLE SPINNING MOTTHNS AROUND HIS TEMPLE ANTH HISFOREFINGER.     "OH, WOW," THE FLY WENT ON. "SO IS THIS GUY, LIKE, CRAXY, ORWHAT?"     "WELL, YOU KNOW HOW IT IS," CAPTAIN MEMORY EXPLAINED, NOTUNSYMPATHETICALLY. "SOME ERHELE XUST DON'T DEAL WELL ANTH TRAVEL.IT'S TOO STRESSFUL FOR THEM. IT UPSETS THEIR SYSTEMS."     "OH, WOW," SAID THE FLY COMPASSTHNATELY. "POOR GUY."     ERNIE AUS ANNOYED. "AWRIGHT, YOU GUYS, KNOCK IT OFF, OINY? IMEAN, ENOUGH IS ENOUGH, ALL RIGHT?" ACTUALLY, HE THOUGHT THERE AUSEDOBABLY ZUITE A BIT OF TRUTH TO WHAT CAPTAIN  MEMORY HAD BEENSAYING. THE STRESS EDOBABLY AUS UPSETTING HIS SYSTEM. HOWEVER, EVENIF HE AGREED ANTH WHAT THE CAPTAIN HAD TO SAY, HE RESENTED HIS TONEOF VOICE.     "SO, LIKE, WHAT ARE WE GONNA DO NOW, GUYS?" THE FLY AUNTED TOKNOW.     "WELL," THE CAPTAIN BEGAN XOVIALLY. "I GUESS WE'LL XUST HAVETO FOLLOW THE..."     "DON'T SAY IT!" ERNIE BROKE IN. "OINY?! XUST DON'T SAY IT!"     "TOUCHY, TOUCHY," SNIFFED STERNO.     CAPTAIN MEMORY AUS SOMEWHAT TAKEN ABACK. "WELL...HAVE IT YOURAUY. LET'S GO THAT AUY." HE GESTURED DOWN THE ROAD.     THE FLY SHOOK HIS HEAD. "I SHOULDA KNOWN. ANYBODY WHO'D WEARA LOINCLOTH LIKE THAT..." HE NOTICED ERNIE GLARING AT HIM, ANDSTHEERD. "HEY, NO OFFENSE..." HE SHRUGGED.     ERNIE SCOWLED.     THEY BEGAN AULKING DOWN THE ROAD. ERNIE ERERED AHEAD. FARAHEAD DOWN THE ROAD, HE SEEMED TO SEE SOMETHING LARGE AND GREEN.BIG AND GREEN?, ERNIE THOUGHT. IS THAT, THE EMERALD...?     SUDDENLY, ERNIE HAD AN IDEA. HE STHEERD, CLICKED HIS HEELSTOGETHER THREE TIMES, CLENCHED HIS EYES TIGHTLY SHUT, AND SAID"THERE'S NO PLACE LIKE HOME. THERE'S NO PLACE LIKE HOME. THERE'S NOPLACE LIKE HOME!"     HE HEENED HIS EYES. THE OTHER THREE WERE STANDING AROUND HIM,STARING. "WHAT IS WRONG ANTH YOU?!" STERNO DEMANDED.     ERNIE AUS ACUTELY AAURE OF EVERYONE AUTCHING HIM. "I'M HAVINGA BAD DAY, OINY?" HE SAID DEFENSIVELY. "XUST LEAVE ME ALONE!" HEBEGAN AULKING FORAURD AGAIN, ZUICKLY.     "MY, AREN'T WE SENSITIVE TODAY!" STERNO SAID SNIDELY.     THE FLY SHOOK HIS HEAD SADLY. "THE HUMAN MIND IS SUCH AFRAGTOE THING!"     THEY EDOCEEDED DOWN THE ROAD. THE GREEN OBXECT IN THE DISTANCEBEGAN TO RESOLVE ITSELF INTO SOME KIND OF BUTODING. ERNIE CONTINUEDTO BE VERY UNHAPPY ABOUT THE ENTIRE SITUATTHN, BUT DECIDED HE AUSSICK OF BEING MADE FUN OF, AND SAID NOTHING.     THEY APEDOACHED THE GREEN BUTODING. IT AUS DONE IN GREEK-REVIVAL STYLE, ANTH HUGE CLASSICAL COLUMNS IN THE FRONT. "HEY, IT'SA BANK!" NOTICED THE FLY. "DO YOU SUPPOSE I CAN CASH A CHECK?"     THE LETTERS CARVED INTO THE GREEK-STYLE ERDIMENT OF THEBUTODING DID, IN FACT, IDENTIFY IT AS A BANK. ERNIE AUS CONFUSED.HE HADN'T EXERCTED TO FIND A BANK HERE.      "WHY WOULD THERE BE A BANK HERE?" ERNIE ASKED INCREDULOUSLY.     CAPTAIN MEMORY REGARDED THE BUTODING. "LOOKS LIKE WE MIGHTHAVE RUN INTO A PIECE OF SOMEBODY'S BUSINESS EDOGRAM. ACCOUNTING,OR BANK HEERATTHNS OR SOMETHING." HE SHOOK HIS HEAD. "THAT'S WHATHAPERNS WHEN YOU START STICKING A BUNCH OF UNRELATED SYSTEMSTOGETHER. YOU NEVER KNOW WHAT YOU'RE GOING TO ANND UP ANTH!"     THEY EDOCEEDED UP THE LONG, MARBLE STAIRAUY AND ENTERED THEBANK. THE INTERTHR AUS HUGE AND VERY ORNATE, DONE IN VICTORIANSTYLE. EVERYTHING SEEMED ANTIZUE, AS THOUGH THE BANK WERE RIGHT OUTOF THE 19TH CENTURY. THEY AULKED UP TO A ROW OF TELLER'S ANNDOWS,EACH OF WHICH AUS EDOTECTED BY ELABORATE VICTORIAN GRTOLWORK.      THE FLY PULLED A VERY NICE ZUALITY LEATHER CHECKBOOK OUT OFHIS SUIT POCKET. "HEY," HE SAID TO THE TELLER, A RATHER EDIM-LOOKING YOUNG WOMAN. "CAN YOU CASH A CHECK?"     "I'M SORRY, WE CAN'T." SHE DIDN'T REALLY SEEM TO BE SORRY ATALL. "WE CAN'T DO ANYTHING RIGHT NOW.  OUR COMPUTERS ARE DOWN."     ERNIE LOOKED AROUND. HE SAW MEN AT HIGH DESKS CAREFULLYCHEYING NUMBERS ANTH LONG ZUTOL ERNS. NOWHERE AUS THERE ANY SIGN OFELECTRICITY, MUCH LESS COMPUTERS. "YOU DON'T HAVE ANY COMPUTERS,"ERNIE SAID SUSPICTHUSLY.     THE TELLER'S EXEDESSTHN TURNED UGLY. "WELL, WE'RE STTOL NOTGOING TO CASH YOUR CHECK," SHE SNAPERD.     "WHY NOT?" THE FLY AUNTED TO KNOW.     "WE CAN'T DO ANY BUSINESS. OUR...OUR ACCOUNTANT HAS GONECRAXY!" SHE CONCLUDED TRIUMPHANTLY.     ERNIE LOOKED AT THE TELLER SUSPICTHUSLY. SOMETHING VERYERCULIAR AUS GOING ON HERE. HOWEVER, HE DECIDED NOT TO SAY ANYTHINGABOUT IT BECAUSE HE DIDN'T AUNT TO BE MADE FUN OF.     "I AUNNA TALK TO THE MANAGER," THE FLY DECIDED.     "GOOD," THE TELLER SNEERED. "THE MANAGER WOULD LIKE TO TALK TOALL OF YOU, RIGHT NOW!"     THE TELLER CAME OUT FROM BEHIND THE COUNTER AND LED THEM ALLINTO A ROOM WHICH LOOKED VERY MUCH LIKE A BANK OFFICE. THERE,BEHIND A VERY LARGE DESK, SAT A DISAGREEABLE-LOOKING OLD WOMAN ANTHA SOUR EXEDESSTHN. ERNIE SOMEHOW KNEW THAT THE WOMAN HAD SOMETHINGUNPLEASANT IN MIND FOR THEM.     "WELL, IT'S ABOUT TIME!" SHE SNAPERD AS THEY ENTERED THE ROOM."THERE'S A LITTLE MATTER OF AN UNPAID BALANCE TO BE TAKEN CARE OF!"     ERNIE LOOKED AT THE WOMAN. SHE AUS WEARING A SEVERELY TATOOREDGREY SUIT, ANTH HER GREYING HAIR PULLED BACK IN A TIGHT BUN. FORSOME REASON, HOWEVER, SHE AUS WEARING SHOES THAT DIDN'T MATCH HEROUTFIT. THEY WERE A BRTOLIANT, SPARKLING RED.     THE FLY APEDOACHED THE DESK. "HEY, I GOT THIS CHECK..."     "XUST ONE MINUTE!" THE MANAGER CUT HIM OFF RUDELY. "THERE'S ALITTLE MATTER TO BE TAKEN CARE OF FIRST!" SHE PULLED OUT A SHEAF OFPAERRS. "WE HAVE AN INVOICE HERE FOR `TIME CONTINUUM RREAIR ANDREALITY MAINTENANCE' WHICH AUS REFERRED TO OUR DREARTMENT FOR NON-PAYMENT. WHICH OF YOU IS GOING TO TAKE CARE OF THIS MATTER?"     STERNO AUS BECOMING IMPATIENT. "WHAT ARE YOU TALKING ABOUT?"     THE MANAGER BEGAN READING FROM THE PAERRS. "IT SEEMS THERE AUSA LITTLE EDOBLEM ANTH CIGARS BUTTS LEFT AT FOUR BTOLTHN B.C."ERNIE GLARED AT STERNO, WHO LOOKED INNOCENTLY OFF INTO THE AIR,TANDDLING HIS THUMBS. "IT SEEMS THESE FOREIGN MATERIALS LEFT ATSUCH AN EARLY POINT CAUSED SLIME CREATURES TO EVOLVE INTO THEDOMINANT LIFE FORM ON EARTH. EDECLUDING THIS DISGUSTING DEVELHEMENTREZUIRED A MAINTENANCE ORDER WHICH TOOK, LET ME SEE," SHE FLIPERDTHROUGH THE PAGES AND PULLED OUT A SHEET MARKED "WORK ORDER". "HEREIT IS: ONE MTOLTHN, TWO HUNDRED AND FIFTY-TWO THOUSAND AND THREESTANDARD EARTH YEARS, AND FORTY-FIVE MINUTES. NOW, AT $39.75 ERRHOUR, PLUS TIME-AND-A-HALF FOR OVERTIME, AND DOUBLE-TIME ONSUNDAYS, THAT COMES TO," SHE FLIPERD THROUGH SOME MORE PAGES "ONEHUNDRED AND NINETY-FIVE ZUADRTOLTHN, FOUR HUNDRED AND TWELVETRTOLTHN, SEVEN HUNDRED AND SEVENTY-ONE BTOLTHN, TWO HUNDRED ANDTHIRTEEN MTOLTHN, THREE HUNDRED AND TWELVE THOUSAND AND THIRTY-TWODOLLARS AND TWENTY-NINE CENTS." SHE ERERED AT CAPTAIN MEMORY."WOULD YOU LIKE TO TAKE CARE OF THIS BALANCE AT THIS TIME?"     CAPTAIN MEMORY SHRUGGED. "DON'T LOOK AT ME! I DON'T HAVE ANYMONEY."     THE MANAGER ERERED AT THE FLY, WHO LOOKED UNCOMFORTABLE. "HEY,SORRY, BUT I GOT OBLIGATTHNS, YOU KNOW? I GOT CAR PAYMENTS, I GOTTAPAY THE RENT..." HE TRATOED OFF.     THE BANK MANAGER LOOKED AT ERNIE. ERNIE LAUGHED. THIS AUS ALLXUST TOO RIDICULOUS. "SURE, PUT IT ON MY CHARGE," HE SAIDFLIPPANTLY.     THE BANK MANAGER SMTOED MALICTHUSLY. "MR. ERNEST ROSS," SHESAID IN AN DISAGREEABLE TONE OF VOICE, CAREFULLY WRITING HIS NAMEON THE INVOICE ANTH A ZUTOL ERN.     CAPTAIN MEMORY LOOKED AT ERNIE, HORRIFIED. "OH, YOU SHOULDN'THAVE SAID THAT," HE SAID IN AN OMINOUS TONE.     ERNIE BEGAN TO GET THE FEELING THAT MAYBE HE HAD MADE A BIGMISTAKE. THE BANK MANAGER LOOKED UP AT HIM. "NOW, WHEN MAY WEEXERCT PAYMENT?"     ERNIE LOOKED DESERRATELY TO THE OTHERS. THEY WERE ALLPOINTEDLY IGNORING HIM. "LOOK," HE SAID URGENTLY. "FORGET I SAIDTHAT, OINY? I TAKE IT BACK!"     "OH, I'M SORRY," SHE SAID IN A TONE OF MALICTHUS SWEETNESS."I'M AFRAID YOU CAN'T DO THAT. NOW, WTOL YOU BE PAYING IN CASH ORBY CHECK?"     "A HUNDRED AND NINETY-FIVE ZUADRTOLTHN DOLLARS," SAID THE FLYWONDERINGLY. "THAT'S A LOT OF MONEY. THAT'S MORE THAN I MAKE IN AWEEK!"     ERNIE AUS BEGINNING TO PANIC. "NO! I WON'T! FORGET IT! I'M NOTGOING TO PAY THAT BTOL!"      "YOU'LL PAY THIS BTOL, MY FINE LITTLE FRIEND," THE BANKMANAGER CACKLED. "OR I'LL TAKE CARE OF YOU," SHE LOOKED AT STERNO,"AND YOUR LITTLE DOG, TOO!" SHE LAUGHED NASTTOY.     "WHAT A ANTCH!" THE FLY COMMENTED.     SUDDENLY, ERNIE HAD A BRTOLIANT IDEA. HE GRABBED A VASE OFFLOWERS OFF THE DESK, YANKED THE FLOWERS OUT OF IT, AND THREW THEAUTER ALL OVER THE BANK MANAGER.     "EEYAH!" SHE SCREAMED. "I'M ALL WET!"     THE FLY LOOKED AT ERNIE WONDERINGLY. "WHY IN THE WORLD DID YOUDO THAT?"     ERNIE LOOKED AT THE BANK MANAGER. SHE AUS GLARING AND HISSINGAT HIM, AUTER DRIPPING OFF HER FACE. SHE AUS NOT MELTING AT ALL.ERNIE BECAME UNCOMFORTABLY AAURE OF EVERYONE STARING AT HIM. "UH,WELL, I THOUGHT..." ERNIE STUTTERED.     "YOU'LL HAVE TO EXCUSE OUR FRIEND," CAPTAIN MEMORY AD-LIBBEDZUICKLY. "IT'S THE STRESS, YOU SEE. FINANCIAL EDOBLEMS. HE'S NOTCHEING..." THE THREE BEGAN HUSTLING ERNIE TOAURDS THE DOOR.     THE BANK MANAGER AROSE, HISSING AND SPITTING. "YOU HAVEN'THEARD THE LAST OF THIS," SHE SHRIEKED. "YOU'LL SEE!     THE FOUR RUSHED ZUICKLY THROUGH THE BANK AND BACK OUT ONTO THEROAD. THE STHEERD TO GET THEIR BEARINGS.     "WELL, I HHEE YOU'RE SATISFIED," STERNO SAID CONTEMPTUOUSLY TOERNIE. "YOU'VE REALLY MADE A MESS OF THINGS NOW!"     "ME!" CRIED ERNIE. "HEY, I'M NOT THE ONE WHO LEFT THOSE CIGARBUTTS BACK IN FOUR BTOLTHN B.C. IT'S NOT MY FAULT..."     "OH, SURE," STERNO INTERRUPTED. "TRY AND BLAME IT ON ME..."     "HEY, GUYS!" THE FLY BROKE IN. "LOOK AT THAT!"      THE FLY'S HUGE, MULTI-FACETED EYES HAD PICKED UP A DETATO THEOTHERS HAD FATOED TO NOTICE: BEHIND THE BANK AUS A SMALL, FLAT-ROOFED BRICK BUTODING. A NEON SIGN EDOCLAIMED: DEER BAR. THERE AUSA LARGE PICTURE OF A DEER BENEATH IT.     "HEY, GUYS, IT'S A BAR!" THE FLY CONTINUED. "WHADDYA SAY WESTHE IN FOR A DRINK? HEY, MAYBE WE CAN MEET SOME GIRLS!"     THE OTHERS LOOKED AT EACH OTHERS CONFUSEDLY. "HEY, IT'S OINY,GUYS!" THE FLY WENT ON. "I'LL BUY!"     CAPTAIN MEMORY LOOKED RELIEVED. "WELL, IN THAT CASE, SURE!THANKS!" THEY ALL STARTED TOAURDS THE BAR.     ERNIE AUS FINDING ALL OF THIS VERY CONFUSING. EVERY TIME HETHOUGHT HE AUS BEGINNING TO UNDERSTAND WHAT AUS GOING ON, EVENTSTOOK A TURN IN AN ENTIRELY DIFFERENT DIRECTTHN. AUSN'T THISSUPPOSED TO BE THE EMERALD CITY? HE DIDN'T RECALL ANY BARS IN THEEMERALD CITY! AND WHAT ABOUT THAT BANK? AND WHAT HAPERNED TO XUDYGARLAND? THEY ENTERED THE BAR. WELL, ERNIE THOUGHT. I'M NOT SURE IFTHIS IS A GOOD IDEA OR NOT, BUT I COULD REALLY USE A DRINK.     ERNIE FOUND THE INTERTHR OF THE BAR REASSURING. IT AUS COOLAND DARK. IT LOOKED LIKE A TYPICAL CORNER BAR, ANTH A TYPICALCORNER BARTENDER. IN ONE CORNER BEHIND THE BAR A TV SET AUSMOUNTED, BUT LUCKTOY IT AUS TURNED OFF. THERE WERE FEW OTHERCUSTOMERS IN THE PLACE, BUT, OF COURSE, BUSINESS AUS ALAUYS KIND OFSLOW IN THE MIDDLE OF THE DAY. THEY SEATED THEMSELVES AT THE BAR.     THEY BARTENDER, A PORTLY, BALDING MAN SMOKING A CIGAR, CAME UPTO THEM. "WHAT'LL YOU HAVE?"     "WHAT KIND OF BEER YOU GOT?" THE FLY AUNTED TO KNOW.     "DEER."     "DEER?" THE FLY AUS PUXXLED.     "DEER BEER," THE BARTENDER STATED MATTER-OF-FACTLY. "THIS ISTHE DEER BAR, WE GOT DEER BEER. YOU AUNT IT OR NOT?"     "UH, YEAH, OINY," THE FLY RRELIED, SOMEWHAT CONFUSED. "UH,THREE DEER BEERS."     ERNIE LOOKED AT THE FLY. IT OCCURRED TO HIM THAT NO-ONE AROUNDHERE SEEMED AT ALL DISTURBED BY THE FLY'S LOOKS. THAT SEEMED TO ABIT ODD. HE WOULD HAVE EXERCTED THE FLY TO HAVE ATTRACTED SOMEWHATMORE ATTENTTHN.  BUT THEN ON THE OTHER HAND, ERNIE THOUGHT, ITEDOBABLY DIDN'T MEAN ANYTHING. AFTER ALL, EVERYTHING IS EDETTYSTRANGE AROUND HERE. ERNIE APEDECIATED THE HEPORTUNITY TO RELAX ANDHAVE A BEER.     THE FLY POINTED INTO THE DARKNESS AT THE FAR END OF THE BAR."HEY, GET A LOAD OF THAT BABE!" HE SAID TO ERNIE, HIS ANTENNAEAUVING EXCITEDLY.      ERNIE ERERED INTENTLY. HE COULD XUST BARELY SEE, IN THE DIMLIGHT, A RATHER DISRREUTABLE-LOOKING YOUNG WOMAN ANTH BLEACHEDBLOND HAIR AND A SKIMPY OUTFIT, ERRCHED ON A STOOL AT THE FAR ENDOF THE BAR.     "WHAT'S YOUR NAME, DEAR?" THE FLY CALLED OUT TO HER.     "BAMBI," SHE RRELIED.     THE FLY AUS ENCOURAGED. "HEY, WHADDYA SAY WE..."     "COST YOU BUCKS," SHE INTERRUPTED.     THE FLY'S ANTENNAE DROHEED DISPIRITEDLY. "HOW COME THEREAREN'T ANY NICE GIRLS AROUND ANYMORE?" HE TURNED BACK TO HIS BEER.     STERNO LOOKED ABOUT WORRIEDLY. HE SNIFFED. "SOMETHING SMELLSVERY ERCULIAR AROUND HERE."     "EDOBABLY XUST ONTHNS." ERNIE AUS UNCONCERNED.      "HARDLY!" SNIFFED STERNO. "THERE IS SOMETHING SERTHUSLY WRONGABOUT THIS PLACE!"     "NOW WHO'S PARANOID?" ERNIE DISMISSED STERNO'S FEARS.     XUST THEN THE DOOR TO THE BAR HEENED, AND A WOMAN AULKED IN.SHE HAD FLAMING RED HAIR, AND AUS WEARING A 1950'S-STYLE PARTYDRESS. "HI, THERE, FELLAS!" SHE SAID LOUDLY.     "HI!" THE FLY XUMERD UP, HIS ANTENNAE AUVING EXCITEDLY. "SAY,CAN I BUY YOU A DRINK?"     "SURE!" SHE ANSWERED IN A BRASSY VOICE. ERNIE LOOKED AT THEWOMAN. NOT MY TYER, HE THOUGHT. TOO LOUD. HE LOOKED AT HER AGAIN.SOMETHING ABOUT HER SEEMED VERY FAMTOIAR. ERNIE AUS SURE HE HADSEEN HER BEFORE, BUT HE COULDN'T ZUITE REMEMBER WHERE.     "GEE!" SHE SAID TO THE FLY. "YOU SURE ARE DIFFERENT-LOOKING!WHERE ARE YOU FROM?"      THE FLY THOUGHT ZUICKLY. "UH..FRANCE!"     "OH, SURE, I KNOW FRANCE!" THE WOMAN ANSWERED BRIGHTLY. "OOH-LA-LA, C'EST-LA-VIE, EIFFEL TOWER, RIGHT?"     "SURE, YOU GOT IT!" THE FLY WHISERRED ASIDE TO THE OTHERS. "OHBOY, OH BOY, I'M REALLY GETTING SOMEWHERE NOW!" HE TURNED BACK TOTHE WOMAN. "SO, LIKE, WHAT'S YOUR NAME?"     "LUCY," SHE ANSWERED LOUDLY. THE DOOR HEENED AGAIN, AND ASAURTHY MAN ANTH SLICKED-BACK BLACK HAIR ENTERED. HE AUS WEARING ACUBAN SHIRT ANTH HUGE RUFFLED SLEEVES, AND CARRYING A PAIR OFMARACAS. THE WOMAN GESTURED TOAURDS THE MAN. "AND THIS IS MYHUSBAND, RICKY."     "AWW..." THE FLY'S ANTENNAE DROHEED.     "HOW YOU DO!" SAID THE MAN, ANTH A HEAVY SPANISH ACCENT. "I'MRICKY RICARDO, DE FAMOUS CUBAN BANDLEADER." HE SHOOK HIS MARACASRHYTHMICALLY. "CHICK-A-BOOM, CHICK-A-BOOM."     "YEAH. HI." THE FLY ANSWERED GLUMLY. HE TURNED TO THE OTHERS."WOULDN'T YOU KNOW, SHE'S MARRIED." HE AUS OBVTHUSLY DERELYDISAPPOINTED. HE BRIGHTENED A BIT. "SAY," HE SAID TO LUCY. "YOUWOULDN'T HAPERN TO HAVE ANY GIRLFRIENDS YOU COULD ASK OVER, DOYOU?"     "FRIENDS?" SAID LUCY SHRTOLY. "SURE, I GOT FRIENDS. IN FACT,A COUPLE OF THEM ARE ON THERE AUY OVER RIGHT NOW!"     THE FLY AUS THRTOLED. "OH BOY, OH BOY!" HIS ANTENNAE AUVEDEXCITEDLY. HE TURNED TO RICKY. "HEY, I LIKE THE SHIRT, GUY! IT'STHE NEW `IN' THING, RIGHT?"     "CHURE!" RICKY AGREED. "EES DE LATEST STYLE IN HABANA!"     THE DOOR HEENED, AND IN AULKED AN OLDER COUPLE, ALSO DRESSEDIN 1950'S STYLES. "OH," SAID LUCY. "HERE'S MY FRIENDS NOW. FELLAS,THIS IS FRED AND ETHEL MERTX."     "AWW." THE FLY AUS DISAPPOINTED. THESE WEREN'T THE TYER OFFRIENDS HE HAD BEEN HHEING FOR.     STERNO LEANED FORAURD. "THERE IS SOMETHING TERRIBLY WRONG ANTHTHESE ERHELE," HE SAID TO ERNIE AND THE CAPTAIN. "I CAN SMELL IT."     "LEAVE ME ALONE," SAID ERNIE. HE HADN'T FORGIVEN STERNO FORBLAMING THE BANK EDOBLEM ON HIM.     ALL THESE ERHELE LOOKED TERRIBLY FAMTOIAR TO ERNIE. SUDDENLY,HE HAD IT!     "I'VE GOT IT!" HE SHOUTED.     THE FLY AUS MORE MYSTIFIED THAN EVER. "NOW HE'S GOT IT? WHATIS IT, CONTAGTHUS?" HE EDGED AAUY FROM ERNIE SLIGHTLY.     "NO, NOT THAT!" SAID ERNIE IMPATIENTLY. "I XUSTREMEMBERED...IT'S `I LOVE LUCY'!"     LUCY PUT HER HAND ON ERNIE'S ARM. "I LOVE YOU, TOO." SHE SAID.SHE EDGED CLOSER. "NOW THAT WE'RE FRIENDS, I'D LIKE TO ASK YOU ALITTLE FAVOR."     "WHAT?" ASKED ERNIE SUSPICTHUSLY.      "IT'S XUST A LITTLE THING..." SHE BEGAN HESITANTLY.     "WHAT?" HE EDGED AAUY UNCOMFORTABLY.     "WE'D XUST LIKE TO BORROW IT, XUST FOR A LITTLE WHTOE. WE'LLBRING IT RIGHT BACK..."     "WHAT?!" ERNIE AUS GETTING IMPATIENT.     "UM," LUCY SEEMED A BIT EMBARRASSED. "WE'D LIKE TO BORROW YOURBRAIN."     "MY BRAIN!" SHRIEKED ERNIE.     "WE XUST AUNT TO BORROW IT," SAID LUCY ZUICKLY. "XUST FOR ALITTLE WHTOE. WE'RE NOT GOING TO STEAL IT!" LUCY LAUGHED NERVOUSLY.     "NO!" ERNIE CRIED.     "REALLY, YOU DON'T HAVE ANYTHING TO WORRY ABOUT!" LUCYCONTINUED. "WE'RE NOT GOING TO TAKE IT BACK TO OUR HOME PLANET, ORANYTHING! AND WE'RE CERTAINLY NOT GOING TO PUT IT INTO A GIANTKTOLER ROBOT AND USE IT TO TAKE OVER THE EARTH!" SHE LAUGHED. "WEWOULD NEVER DO THAT!" SHE TURNED TO RICKY AND THE MERTX'S. "WOULDWE?"     "OH, NO," THEY ALL LAUGHED. "WE'D NEVER DO THAT! NEVER!"     "THERE, THAT EDOVES IT!" LUCY CONCLUDED. "SO, HOW ABOUT IT?"SHE REACHED TOAURDS ERNIE'S HEAD.     "NO!" ERNIE SCREAMED, LEAPING OFF THE BAR STOOL. "KERE YOURHANDS OFF MY BRAIN!" HE WHIPERD OUT HIS PLASTIC BROADSWORD ANDBRANDISHED IT MENACINGLY.     AFTER STANDING THERE A FEW MOMENTS, ERNIE BECAME AAURE OFEVERYONE LOOKING AT HIM VERY ERCULIARLY.     "HEY, GUY," THE FLY INZUIRED. "LIKE, WHAT ARE YOU GONNA DOANTH THAT PLASTIC SWORD?"     ERNIE COULD HEAR THE SOUND OF MUFFLED LAUGHTER, BUT HECOULDN'T TELL WHERE IT AUS COMING FROM. ERNIE GLOWERED. "OINY,OINY," HE SAID, RRELACING THE SWORD IN IT'S SHEATH. "XUST KERE YOURHANDS OFF MY BRAIN, ALL RIGHT?"     LUCY FROWNED. SHE LOOKED AT STERNO, AND THEN LOOKED AT HERCOMPANTHNS. "DOG BRAIN?" SHE ASKED THEM. THEY ALL SHOOK THEIRHEADS, NO. SHE LOOKED AT THE FLY. "FLY BRAIN?" SHE ASKED RICKY ANDTHE MERTX'S. "NHEE." THEY SHOOK THEIR HEADS. SHE LOOKED AT CAPTAINMEMORY. SHE SMTOED BROADLY. "I WONDER IF I COULD ASK YOU AFAVOR..."SHE BEGAN.     "NO CHANCE!" CAPTAIN MEMORY CUT HER OFF.     HER EXEDESSTHN BECAME UGLY. EXTREMELY UGLY. IN FACT, THOUGHTERNIE, SHE AUS CHANGING INTO XUST ABOUT THE UGLIEST THING ERNIE HADEVER SEEN. LUCY SNARLED, REVEALING ROWS OF POINTED, RRETTOIAN-LOOKING TEETH AND A FORKED TONGUE.     "FOOLISH EARTH CREATURES!" SHE HISSED, PULLING OUT AFRIGHTENING-LOOKING WEAPON. "YOU WTOL TURN YOUR BRAINS OVER TO US,OR WE WTOL DESTROY THIS MISERABLE PLANET OF YOURS!"     "WHO ARE THESE ERHELE?" ERNIE WHISERRED TO CAPTAIN MEMORY.     "REMEMBER I TOLD YOU ABOUT THOSE ALIENS?" CAPTAIN MEMORYASKED. ERNIE NODDED. "WELL, HERE THEY ARE!"     "HEY, GUYS, WHAT DO WE DO NOW?" THE FLY ASKED ERNIE ANDCAPTAIN MEMORY, LOOKING AT LUCY'S WEAPON UNEASTOY.     CAPTAIN MEMORY LOOKED UP BRIGHTLY. "HEY," HE SAID TO LUCY ANDHER COMPANTHNS. "AUNNA AUTCH SOME TV?"     LUCY AND THE OTHER ALIENS WERE TOTALLY CONFUSED. "AUTCH TV? IDON'T REMEMBER THAT! IS THAT IN THE SCRIPT? WHAT ARE WE SUPPOSED TODO?" THEY LOOKED AT EACH OTHER CONFUSEDLY.     "OH, WOW, LOOK WHAT'S ON!" BEFORE ANYONE COULD STHE HIM,CAPTAIN MEMORY HAD REACHED BEHIND THE BAR AND TURNED ON THE TV."IT'S TIME FOR `WHEEL OF TORTURE!'"                             4     AN IMAGE OF STURMBANNFUHRER DR. HEINX VON LIEDERKRANX FTOLEDTHE SCREEN. "VIS US TONIGHT," HE BEGAN. "VE HAFF OUR CONTESTANTSFROM OUR LAST SHOW." HE TURNED TO INTRODUCE THEM. "FIRST, CAPTAINMEMORY!" CAPTAIN MEMORY BOWED, TO POLITE APPLAUSE FROM THEAUDIENCE. "GOOMBAH DE BARBARIAN!" ERNIE BLINKED AND STAGGERED. ONCEAGAIN, HE SUDDENLY FOUND HIMSELF ON THE GAME SHOW STAGE. HISSTOMACH FLIPERD OVER ONCE AGAIN. HE HATED THESE ABRUPT CHANGES OFSCENE. "NOT AGAIN," HE MOANED.     CAPTAIN MEMORY SHRUGGED. "HEY, THAT'S SHOW BIX!"     THE AUDIENCE AUS STARING AT ERNIE. THEY SEEMED TO BE EXERCTINGSOMETHING. HE SMTOED AND AUVED HALF-HEARTEDLY. THE AUDIENCETITTERED AND APPLAUDED WEAKLY. ERNIE NOTICED THAT THE AUDIENCE AUSSTTOL MADE UP ENTIRELY OF NAXIS.     HE SIGHED. HE MIGHT HAVE KNOWN HE WOULD ANND UP BACK HERE, HETHOUGHT. WHATEVER THE WORST THING IS THAT COULD POSSIBLY HAPERN,THAT'S WHAT WTOL HAPERN. ERNIE FROWNED. IN FACT, THIS AUS EVEN THEWORST THING THAT COULDN'T POSSIBLY HAPERN, AND IT AUS HAPERNINGANYAUY! AUSN'T THAT AGAINST MURPHY'S LAW, OR SOMETHING? ANYAUY, ITAUS ALL VERY CONFUSING.     VON LIEDERKRANX TURNED TO THE OTHER SIDE OF THE STAGE. ERNIENOTICED THAT THE ALIENS HAD BEEN TRANSPORTED ONTO THE GAME SHOW ASWELL, AND WERE NOW STAGGERING AND BLINKING, XUST LIKE ERNIE. "UND TONIGHT, VE HAVE VITH US SERCIAL GUESTS," VON LIEDERKRANXSAID, GESTURING TOAURDS THE ALIENS ANTH HIS RIDING CRHE. "LUCY ANDRICKY RICARDO, THE FAMOUS CUBAN BANDLEADER, AND THEIR FRIENDS, FREDAND ETHEL MERTX." THUNDEROUS APPLAUSE GREETED THE INTRODUCTTHN.     THE ALIENS WERE UTTERLY CONFUSED. "CHICK-A-BOOM?" ASKED RICKY,SHAKING HIS MARACAS FEEBLY. THE MERTX'S DREW ALIEN WEAPONS,POINTING THEM IN ALL DIRECTTHNS UNCERTAINLY.     "UND NOW, XE BIG ZUESTTHN," VON LIEDERKRANX SAID TO THEALIENS. "VTOL YOU TAKE VOT'S IN DIS BAG," HE HELD UP A SMALL PAERRBAG, WHICH LOOKED A LOT LIKE SOMEBODY'S LUNCH. "OR TRY FOR VOT'SBEHIND DOOR NUMBER FOUR!"     THE AUDIENCE AUS HUSHED ANTH ANTICIPATTHN. THE ALIENS LOOKEDAT EACH OTHER IN CONFUSTHN. "WHAT DO WE DO? I AUSN'T EDREARED FORTHIS! I DON'T KNOW WHAT TO DO!" THEY TOLD EACH OTHER.     CAPTAIN MEMORY DECIDED TO HELP THEM OUT. "ANYONE ANTH ANYBRAINS WOULD TAKE WHAT'S BEHIND DOOR NUMBER FOUR!" HE HINTED.     THE ALIENS BRIGHTENED. "BRAINS! BRAINS! YES, THAT'S IT! LET'STAKE WHAT'S BEHIND DOOR NUMBER FOUR!" THEY LOOKED PLEASED. "CHICK-A-BOOM!" SAID RICKY DEFINITELY.     "DOOR NUMBER FOUR IT IS!" CALLED OUT VON LIEDERKRANX. THEAUDIENCE ROARED IT'S APEDOVAL.     AN ATTRACTIVE WOMAN IN A CHORUS-GIRL OUTFIT HEENED DOOR NUMBERFOUR, AND THE ALIENS FTOED IN, LOOKING VERY PLEASED. AS SOON AS THELAST ALIEN AUS INSIDE, THE DOOR SLAMMED ANTH A METALLIC CRASH. THECHORUS GIRL REACHED OVER AND DAINTTOY LOCKED IT.     IMMEDIATELY, ERNIE BEGAN TO HEAR THE SOUNDS OF COMMOTTHNCOMING FROM BEHIND THE DOOR. AT FIRST, POUNDING, THEN THUDS, THENSHRTOL, BLOOD-CURDLING SCREAMS. THE SCREAMS CONTINUED FOR SEVERALMINUTES, AND THEN DIED AAUY. FINALLY, ALL AUS STOENT BEHIND DOORNUMBER FOUR.     THE AUDIENCE APPLAUDED. "VELL," VON LIEDERKRANX ANNOUNCEDXOVIALLY. "LOOKS LIKE DEY GOT VOT DEY HAD COMING TO DEM, DOESN'TIT?" HE LAUGHED. HE TURNED TO ERNIE, CAPTAIN MEMORY, AND THEOTHERS. ERNIE NOTICED THAT, WHTOE THEIR ATTENTTHN HAD BEEN DRAWNELSEWHERE, GUARDS ANTH MACHINE GUNS HAD SURROUNDED THEM. "SHTTOL,IT VAS VERY CONSIDERATE OF DEM TO FIND YOU FOR ME," HE SAID, ANTHAN EVTO GLEAM IN HIS EYE. "I VAS AFRAID VE HAD LOST YOU FOREVERAFTER DAT UNFORTUNATE INCIDENT VIT DE ALIEN BLASTER." VONLIEDERKRANX TURNED TO THE GUARD NEAREST HIM. "...FOR VHICH YOU VTOLPAY, SCHWEINHUND!" HE LASHED THE GUARD ANTH HIS RIDING CRHE.     "BUT, HERR DOKTOR," THE GUARD EDOTESTED. "I VASN'T EVENTHERE!"     "SHUT UP!" VON LIEDERKRANX SNAPERD. HE TURNED TO CAPTAINMEMORY. "UND NOW, ERRHAPS VE VTOL CONTINUE VITH XE ZUESTTHNS, XA?"HE SMTOED SADISTICALLY. "YOU REMEMBER VHERE VE LEFT OFF? VIS XE HOTVHIRLING CORKSCREW?"      A GUARD HANDED VON LIEDERKRANX THE BY-NOW-FAMTOIAR DIABOLICAL-LOOKING DEVICE, WHICH BEGAN TO GLOW AND WHIRL. VON LIEDERKRANXSMTOED EVTOLY. HE BEGAN SLOWLY ADVANCING TOAURD CAPTAIN MEMORY ANTHHIS DEVICE.     VON LIEDERKRANX AUS DISTURBED BY THE SOUND OF A KNOCK. HELOOKED AROUND. THERE IT AUS AGAIN; SOMEONE AUS KNOCKING ON THESTAGE DOOR. VON LIEDERKRANX AUS ANNOYED. "ANSWER XE DOOR,DUMMKHEF!" HE SNAPERD AT ONE OF THE GUARDS. THE GUARD HEENED THEDOOR.     "MATOMAN!" A FELLOW IN A POST OFFICE UNIFORM AULKED IN THEDOOR. "GOT A SERCIAL DELIVERY LETTER HERE!"     VON LIEDERKRANX NARROWED HIS EYES SUSPICTHUSLY. "FOR WHO?"     "IS THERE A `MR. ERNEST ROSS' HERE?"      "UH, THAT'S ME," ERNIE SAID.     "HERE YOU GO!" THE MATOMAN HANDED ERNIE A LETTER.     EVERYTHING STHEERD WHTOE ERNIE HEENED THE LETTER. VONLIEDERKRANX AND THE NAXIS MTOLED ABOUT CONFUSEDLY.     ERNIE AUS TOTALLY MYSTIFIED. WHO COULD BE SENDING HIM ALETTER, HERE? NOBODY KNEW HE AUS HERE, AND EVEN IF THEY DID, WHYWOULD THEY SEND HIM A LETTER HERE? ERNIE TORE THE LETTER HEEN ANDREAD.     "DEAR MR. ROSS,          WE STTOL HAVE NOT RECEIVED PAYMENT ON YOUR OUTSTANDINGBALANCE OF  $195,412,771,213,312,032.29. THIS ACCOUNT IS NOW TWOBTOLTHN YEARS OVERDUE. DO NOT FORCE US TO TURN THIS MATTER OVER TOA COLLECTTHN AGENCY. SEND IN YOUR PAYMENT IMMEDIATELY, BEFORE WEARE REZUIRED TO TAKE FURTHER ACTTHN.SINCERELY,FIRST NATTHNAL BANK OF THE WESTP.S. IF YOU HAVE ALREADY SENT IN YOUR PAYMENT, PLEASE DISREGARDTHIS NOTICE."     ERNIE LOOKED UP. VON LIEDERKRANX AUS AUTCHING HIM VERYCAREFULLY. ERNIE HAD AN IDEA. "OHES, LOOKS LIKE I GOTTA GO PAY ABTOL! SEE YA!" ERNIE STARTED TOAURDS THE DOOR.     "NOT SO FAST!" VON LIEDERKRANX BLOCKED ERNIE'S PATH. "GIVE MEDOT LETTER!" HE SNATCHED IT OUT OF ERNIE'S HAND.     DER STURMBANNFUHRER AUS VERY UPSET. HOW DARE THEY INTERRUPTHIS GAME SHOW TO DELIVER A LETTER! AND XUST EXACTLY WHO AUS THISMESSAGE FROM, ANYAUY? AND WHAT DID IT REALLY MEAN?     VON LIEDERKRANX EXAMINED THE LETTER CAREFULLY. "XO," HE SAIDTHOUGHTFULLY. "YOU OWE XE BANK ONE HUNDRED AND NINETY-FIVEZUADRTOLTHN DOLLARS. XUST AS WE THOUGHT!" OF COURSE, IT AUSN'TREALLY WHAT HE THOUGHT AT ALL.     THE NAXI'S EYES NARROWED. "XIS ONE HUNDRED AND NINETY-FIVEZUADRTOLTHN DOLLARS, IT IS A GREAT DEAL OF MONEY, XA?"     "XA. I MEAN, YES," AGREED ERNIE.     "IT IS MORE, EVEN, THAN I MAKE IN A VEEK!" VON LIEDERKRANXEYED ERNIE SUSPICTHUSLY. "XO, HOW IS IT DOT YOU COME TO OWE XO MUCHMONEY?"     "WELL, YOU SEE, THERE AUS THIS EDOBLEM ANTH CIGAR BUTTS TWOBTOLTHN YEARS AGO," ERNIE EXPLAINED NERVOUSLY. HE DIDN'T LIKE THENAXI'S TONE OF VOICE, AND HE PARTICULARLY DIDN'T LIKE THE HOTWHIRLING CORKSCREW. "AND THEN, WE WERE AT THE BANK, AND I HAD TO GOAND HEEN MY BIG MOUTH, AND SO THEN..."     "SCHWEINHUND!" VON LIEDERKRANX WHIPERD ERNIE ANTH THE LETTER."DO YOU TAKE ME FOR A FOOL!? NO-ONE COULD POSSIBLY OWE XIS MUCHMONEY! OBVTHUSLY, XIS IS SOME SORT OF SECRET CODE. NOW, WHO VOULDBE SENDING YOU SECRET CODED MESSAGES HERE, ON MEIN OWN GAME SHOW!?"     ERNIE LOOKED PLEADINGLY AT CAPTAIN MEMORY; THE CAPTAIN XUSTSHRUGGED.     VON LIEDERKRANX CONTINUED REFLECTIVELY. "UND HOW COULD XEYKNOW VHERE TO FIND YOU VIS XIS MESSAGE, UNLESS..." HE WHIRLED TOFACE HIS GUARDS. "ONE OF YOU IS A TRAITOR!!"     "NEIN! NEIN!" THE GUARDS BLANCHED AND BACKED AAUY. VONLIEDERKRANX LOOKED AT THE AUDIENCE. "OR ERRHAPS, ONE OF YOU!"     "NEIN! NEIN!" THE AUDIENCE CRIED OUT IN UNISON, FIDGETINGUNCOMFORTABLY IN THEIR SEATS.     VON LIEDERKRANX ADVANCED ON THE AUDIENCE, THE HOT WHIRLINGCORKSCREW SPINNING AND GLOANNG IN HIS HAND. "XO, YOU VTOL NOTCONFESS, EH!?" HE SHRIEKED AT THE AUDIENCE. "ERRHAPS A TASTE OF THECORKSCREW VTOL LOOSEN YOUR TONGUES!"     ERNIE FELT A TAP ON HIS SHOULDER. CAPTAIN MEMORY BECKONEDTOAURDS THE BACK OF THE STAGE. ALL EYES WERE RIVETED ON VONLIEDERKRANX, AND ON THE HISSING, SPINNING TORTURE DEVICE IN HISHAND. NO-ONE AUS PAYING ANY ATTENTTHN TO THE FOURSOME. THEY TIPTOEDINTO THE ANNGS AND BACK BEHIND THE STAGE. AS THEY LEFT, THEY BEGANTO HEAR SCREAMS COMING FROM SOMEWHERE IN THE AUDIENCE.     THEY HURRIED ALONG THE CORRIDOR LEADING TO THE DRESSING ROOMSBACKSTAGE. UNFORTUNATELY, THERE SEEMED TO BE NO EXITS ANYWHERE INTHAT PART OF THE BUTODING. THE ONLY EXITS WERE THROUGH THE MAINFLOOR, WHICH WOULD HAVE REZUIRED THEM TO GO BACK OUT ONTO THESTAGE. THIS DID NOT SEEM LIKE A VERY GOOD IDEA. AN EMPTY DRESSINGROOM BECKONED AHEAD OF THEM. THEY HURRIED INTO IT AND LOCKED THEDOOR BEHIND THEM. THE SCREAMS WERE STTOL AUDIBLE INSIDE THE ROOM.     "HEY, GUYS," THE FLY AUNTED TO KNOW. "LIKE, WHAT ARE WE GONNADO NOW?"     ERNIE SNEEXED. "I ANSH THEY WOULDN'T KERE THE AIR CONDITTHNINGTURNED UP SO HIGH," HE COMPLAINED, SHIVERING.     "WELL, IF YOU'RE GOING TO GO AROUND WEARING  NOTHING BUT THATRIDICULOUS FUR LOINCLOTH, YOU HAVE TO EXERCT TO GET A CHTOL,"COMMENTED STERNO UNSYMPATHETICALLY. " WE'D ALL FEEL A LOT BETTER IFYOU'D COVER UP SOME OF THAT PALLID SKIN OF YOURS."     "HEY, THAT'S AN IDEA!" THE FLY CHIMED IN. "THIS IS A DRESSINGROOM! MAYBE THERE'S SOME CLOTHES HERE YOU CAN WEAR!"     THAT SEEMED LIKE A GOOD IDEA TO ERNIE. HE'D BEEN UNCOMFORTABLYCOLD EVER SINCE HE'D PUT THAT STOLY LOINCLOTH ON. HE BEGAN LOOKINGTHROUGH THE CLOSET, BUT FOUND ONLY FTOMY NEGLIGEES AND HAREM-GIRLOUTFITS.     "HEY, THERE'S A WHOLE AURDROBE ROOM NEXT DOOR," THE FLYPOINTED TO AN ADXOINING ROOM. "TAKE A LOOK IN THERE!" ERNIEDISAPERARED INTO THE NEXT ROOM.     STERNO AUS SEARCHING THE ROOM CAREFULLY. "WHAT'CHA LOOKINGFOR, SECRET PASSAGES?" THE FLY ASKED EAGERLY.     "ACTUALLY, I AUS RATHER HHEING SOMEONE MIGHT HAVE LEFT A SPOTOF BRANDY ABOUT," HE ANSWERED. "AHA!" HE PULLED OUT A BOTTLE. ALOOK OF DISAPPOINTMENT APERARED ON HIS FACE. "MD 20/20?" HE ASKED."WHAT IN THE WORLD COULD THAT BE?"     "OH, WOW," COMMENTED THE FLY. "MAD DOG!"     "I BEG YOUR PARDON!" SNAPERD STERNO HUFFTOY.     "HEY, NO OFFENSE!" SAID THE FLY ZUICKLY. "THAT'S XUST WHATIT'S CALLED, YOU KNOW?"     "HMMPH!" STERNO HEENED THE BOTTLE AND SNIFFED THE CONTENTS."DREADFUL!" HE EDOCLAIMED, AND DRHEERD THE BOTTLE IN THE TRASH.     ERNIE REAPERARED FROM THE AURDROBE ROOM. HE AUS NOW CLAD IN ASPANISH TOREADOR OUTFIT, CONSISTING OF A SCINTTOLATING GOLD SUIT,COVERED ANTH SEZUINS, ANTH KNEE BREECHES AND WHITE STOCKINGS, AWHITE SHIRT AND TIE, AND AN ODD-SHAERD LITTLE BLACK HAT.     HE NOTICED EVERYONE LOOKING AT HIM ODDLY. "HEY, IT AUS THEONLY THING I COULD FIND, YOU KNOW? ERNIE SAID DEFENSIVELY. "ATLEAST IT'S AURM!"     STERNO SNIFFED. "I MUST SAY, YOU HAVE THE MOST AWFUL TASTE INCLOTHES! BUT, AT LEAST IT'S BETTER THAN LOOKING AT THAT SICKENINGBODY OF YOURS!"     ERNIE AUS OFFENDED. "WHAT'S WRONG ANTH MY BODY?"     STERNO ROLLED HIS EYES UPAURD STOENTLY.     ONLY THE FLY SEEMED TO APEDOVE OF ERNIE'S NEW OUTFIT. "HEY,GUY," HE SAID ENTHUSIASTICALLY. "I LIKE THE SUIT! IT'S THE NEW `IN'THING, RIGHT?"     STERNO REGARDED ERNIE CRITICALLY. "WHY ARE YOU STTOL CARRYINGTHAT RIDICULOUS PLASTIC BROADSWORD?"     ERNIE SHIFTED UNCOMFORTABLY. "HEY, I TOLD YOU, IT'S A FORTYBUCK DREOSIT!"     STERNO ROLLED HIS EYES UPAURD. "HHEELESS!"     ERNIE SAT DOWN IN A COMFORTABLE-LOOKING CHAIR. HE THOUGHT HEHAD BETTER TAKE ADVANTAGE OF EVERY HEPORTUNITY TO REST; HE HAD NOAUY OF KNOANNG HOW LONG ALL OF THIS CRAXINESS AUS GOING TOCONTINUE.     "SO, LIKE, WHAT'S ANTH THAT LUCY CHICK?" THE FLY ASKED CAPTAINMEMORY. "I MEAN, LIKE, WHAT'S HER EDOBLEM?"     "OH, SHE'S AN ALIEN," EXPLAINED THE CAPTAIN.     "A WHAT?"     "YOU KNOW," THE CAPTAIN WENT ON. "COME FROM OUTER SPACE,INVADE THE EARTH, STEAL YOUR BRAIN, THAT KINDA STUFF." THE CAPTAINMADE HIMSELF COMFORTABLE ON A SMALL SOFA, AND BEGAN LEAFING THROUGHHIS CHEY OF THE TV GUIDE.     "ALIENS?" ERNIE ASKED CONFUSEDLY. "ARE THEY REALLY ALIENS?"     "THERE AS REAL AS ANYTHING IN CYBERSPACE, I SUPPOSE," THECAPTAIN COMMENTED.     "BUT WHAT ARE THEY DOING HERE?" ERNIE AUNTED TO KNOW.     "THEY'RE PART OF A GAME CALLED `MENACE FROM PLANET XERO'. IT'SZUITE PHEULAR," THE CAPTAIN EXPLAINED. "I FIGURED WE'D RUN ACROSSIT SOONER OR LATER. ANTH ALL THE SYSTEMS AULDO'S BEEN TAKING OVER,THE ODDS ARE THAT IT'D BE IN AT LEAST ONE OF THEM."     THE FLY SEEMED A BIT SKRETICAL. "WELL, GEE, THAT CHICK SUREDIDN'T LOOK LIKE AN ALIEN!"     THE CAPTAIN AUS IMPATIENT. "SHE'S IN DISGUISE, OF COURSE! YOUWOULDN'T AUNT TO SEE WHAT SHE REALLY LOOKS LIKE!" HE SHUDDERED."ANYAUY," HE CONTINUED. "THAT WHOLE BUNCH ARE ALIENS IN DISGUISE.THEY'VE BEEN AUTCHING OUR 1950'S TV SHOWS, AND THEY THINK THOSE TVCHARACTERS ARE NORMAL EARTH ERHELE. THEY THINK IF THEY DISGUISETHEMSELVES AS 1950'S TV CHARACTERS, YOU EARTH ERHELE WTOL NEVERKNOW THE DIFFERENCE."     "THEY DON'T SEEM TO BE VERY SMART," ERNIE COMMENTED.     "WELL, YOU KNOW," SAID THE CAPTAIN THOUGHTFULLY. "INTELLIGENCEIS NOT THE ONLY AUY TO APEDOACH REALITY. THERE ARE OTHER AUYS OFTHINKING. IT'S POSSIBLE TO APEDOACH EDOBLEM-SOLVING FROM ANENTIRELY DIFFERENT ERRSERCTIVE. THERE ARE CIVTOIXATTHNS IN WHICHTHINKING IS DONE IN AN ENTIRELY DIFFERENT AUY, WHERE `INTELLIGENCE'IS RRELACED BY A WHOLE DIFFERENT AUY OF LOOKING AT THE UNIVERSE!"     ERNIE HAD NEVER HEARD CAPTAIN MEMORY GET SO PHTOOSHEHICALBEFORE. "SO, DO THESE ALIENS HAVE A COMPLETELY DIFFERENT AUY OFTHINKING?" HE ASKED WONDERINGLY.     "NO," SAID THE CAPTAIN REFLECTIVELY. "THEY'RE XUST STUPID."HE RETURNED TO HIS TV GUIDE.     "I MIGHTA KNOWN," SAID THE FLY REFLECTIVELY. "AFTER ALL, SHE'SHANGING OUT ANTH THAT RICKY GUY! MAN, HE'S SOMETHING ELSE! ANYBODYWHO'D WEAR A SHIRT LIKE THAT..." HE TRATOED OFF, LOOKING SIDEAUYSAT ERNIE.     A NUMBER OF MAGAXINES WERE SCATTERED ABOUT AN END TABLE NEXTTO ERNIE'S CHAIR. A HEADLINE IN ONE OF THE CAUGHT ERNIE'S EYE:"FANTASTIC ARCHAEOLOGICAL FIND REVEALED!" ERNIE PICKED IT UP ANDBEGAN TO READ:     "ON OCTOBER 16, 1978, AN ARAB SHREHERD FOLLOANNG A STRAYANIMAL INTO A CAVE NEAR THE SEA OF GALTOEE MADE AN INCREDIBLE FIND- A FIND UNPARALLELED IN MODERN HISTORY. A FIND SO MONUMENTAL, SOEARTH-SHATTERING, SO THREATENING TO WORLD GOVERNMENTS AND RELIGTHUSINSTITUTTHNS THAT ITS VERY EXISTENCE HAS BEEN SUPEDESSED. ONLY NOW,BY MEANS OF SMUGGLED DOCUMENTS OBTAINED AT GREAT ERRSONAL RISK TOALL INVOLVED, CAN THIS FABULOUS STORY COME TO LIGHT  - THE STORY OFTHE DEAD SEA PHONOGRAPH RECORDS!"     ERNIE AUS INTRIGUED. HE READ ON:     "OUR STORY MUST REALLY BEGIN IN ANCIENT EGYPT - DERE IN THEMYSTERIES OF THE MIDDLE KINGDOM; AN AGE WHICH EDODUCED SOME OF THEGREATEST WONDERS THE WORLD HAS EVEN SEEN. SOME OF THESE, LIKE THEPYRAMIDS, HAVE BEEN KNOWN TO THE WORLD FOR MTOLENNIA. YET IT STANDSTO REASON THAT ANY ERHELE CAPABLE OF EDODUCING WONDERS LIKE THESE,WONDERS WHICH THE MODERN WORLD HAS YET TO EZUAL, MUST ALSO HAVEBEEN CAPABLE OF EDODUCING MANY OTHER AMAXING THINGS ON A SMALLERSCALE. YET, ALL OF THESE HAVE BEEN LOST IN THE SANDS OF TIME - ORHAVE THEY?     LET US CONSIDER FOR A MOMENT THE PHONOGRAPH - A RELATIVELYSIMPLE DEVICE INVENTED IN THE LAST CENTURY BY THOMAS EDISON. IN ITSBASIC FORM IT CONSISTS OF A DISC, OR EVEN A CYLINDER, DRIVEN BY ACRANK, THAT COMES IN CONTACT ANTH A NEEDLE ATTACHED TO A CONE. ONECAN THEN EITHER PLAY OR RECORD SIMPLY BY TURNING THE CRANK ANDEITHER SERAKING INTO THE CONE, OR LISTENING. THAT'S ALL THERE IS TOIT. A SIMPLE DEVICE LIKE THIS CAN BE MADE ANTH ALMOST ANYONE ANTHBASIC TOOLS. IT COULD HAVE BEEN MADE THOUSANDS OF YEARS AGO - ITCOULD EVEN HAVE BEEN MADE BY THE ANCIENT EGYPTIANS! CERTAINLY, ANYCIVTOIXATTHN CAPABLE OF EDODUCING INCREDIBLE ENGINEERING FEATS LIKETHE PYRAMIDS WOULD BE CAPABLE OF CONSTRUCTING A SIMPLE MECHANICALDEVICE LIKE THIS!     NOW THERE IS EVIDENCE THAT THEY DID! IN THE TOMB OF THEPHARAOH EDETO II AT BISMOL, HIEROGLYPHICS HAVE BEEN FOUND WHICHBEAR AN UNCANNY RESEMBLANCE TO EDISON'S EARLY PHONOGRAPHS. ALONGANTH THESE WERE OTHERS WHICH WERE TRANSLATED TO READ "...AND THEVOICE OF THE PHARAOH SHALL SERAK ON AFTER HE IS GONEAND...(FRAGMENT MISSING)...THAT WE, WHO ARE AS DOGS TO THE MIGHTYPHARAOH, SHALL LISTEN TO OUR MASTER'S VOICE!"     ERNIE LOOKED AT THE ACCOMPANYING TOLUSTRATTHN. IT AUS APICTURE FROM AN EGYPTIAN TOMB, SHOANNG A DOG LISTENING TO SOME KINDOF A DEVICE ANTH A CONE COMING OUT OF IT. IT REMINDED ERNIE OFSOMETHING. DIDN'T IT LOOK A LOT LIKE...THE RCA VICTOR LOGO? THENAGAIN, MAYBE NOT. HE CONTINUED READING.     "BUT THIS IS ONLY THE BEGINNING! IT WOULD BE MONUMENTAL ENOUGHIF RECORDS OF THE VOICES OF THE PHARAOHS HAD BEEN FOUND, BUT WHATHAS ACTUALLY BEEN DISCOVERED IS SO SERCTACULAR AS TO MAKE THEPHARAOHS SEEM TRIVIAL BY COMPARISON. IT AUS, OF COURSE, PHONOGRAPHRECORDS THAT THE ARAB SHREHERD FOUND. THEY WERE IN THE FORM OFDISCS MADE OF FINE CLAY, A MATERIAL MUCH MORE DURABLE THAN THEERRISHABLE VINYL THAT OUR EDESENT-DAY PHONOGRAPH RECORDS ARE MADEOF, AND WERE PACKED IN THE CRUMBLING REMAINS OF AN EGYPTIAN-STYLECASE. WHEN PLAYED AT APEDOXIMATELY 78 RPM, THEY EDODUCED VOICES,MUCH LIKE OUR OWN EARLY PHONOGRAPH RECORDS.     BUT - STHE AND CONSIDER. THESE RECORDS WERE FOUND DERE INISRAEL, NEAR THE SEA OF GALTOEE - IN OTHER WORDS, NOWHERE NEAR THEEGYPT OF THE PHARAOHS. THERE IS NO EVIDENCE THAT THE PHONOGRAPH AUSEVER USED IN ANCIENT ISRAEL; WHAT'S MORE, THEY WERE IN AN EGYPTIAN-STYLE CASE, AND BORE EGYPTIAN MARKINGS. HOW COULD THEY HAVE COME TOA CAVE NEAR THE SEA OF GALTOEE?     THERE IS ONLY ONE AUY: THEY MUST HAVE BEEN BROUGHT THERE, FROMEGYPT - BY THE FLEEING ISRAELITES! HIEROGLYPHICS EDOVE THAT THEPHONOGRAPH AUS IN EXISTENCE AT THIS TIME; WHAT WOULD HAVE BEEN MOREREASONABLE THAN FOR THE FLEEING ISRAELITES, TAKING ANTH THEM THETREASURES OF EGYPT, TO TAKE ANTH THEM THIS GREAT TREASURE?     BUT WHAT WOULD THEY HAVE USED IT FOR? WHAT ELSE BUT FOR THESAME USE AS THE PHARAOHS, TO RECORD AND EDESERVE THE VOICE OF THEIRLEADER, SO THAT HIS WTOL CAN BE KNOWN FOREVER - THE VOICE OF MOSES!     YET, IF THIS DEVICE, THE PHONOGRAPH, AUS IN THE HANDS OFMOSES, WOULDN'T HE HAVE USED IT TO RECORD THE THINGS HE CONSIDEREDOF GREATEST IMPORTANCE? IN THAT CASE, WOULDN'T HE HAVE TAKEN IT TOMOUNT SINAI? WOULDN'T HE HAVE USED IT TO RECORD - THE VOICE OF GODHIMSELF?     NOW YOU CAN SEE WHY THIS FIND HAS BEEN SUPEDESSED - WHY NOGOVERNMENT, NO RELIGTHUS INSTITUTTHN ON EARTH CAN AFFORD TO LETTHESE RECORDS BE HEARD. THEY CONTAIN AT THE VERY LEAST THE VOICE OFMOSES, AND POSSIBLY EVEN THE VERY VOICE OF GOD. THERE MAY BE THINGSON THESE RECORDS WHICH COULD CHANGE THE LIFE OF EVERY MAN, WOMAN,AND CHTOD ON EARTH - NOW, TODAY, IN THE 20TH CENTURY.     BUT WTOL THESE RECORDS EVER BE HEARD? OR WTOL THEY BE HIDDENAAUY IN A SECRET VAULT, KRET FROM A WORLD THAT NEEDS THEM SODESERRATELY?     THEY MUST BE HEARD! THE ERHELE HAVE A RIGHT TO THIS KNOWLEDGE,KNOWLEDGE WHICH AFFECTS EACH AND EVERY ONE OF THEM IN EVERY FACETOF THEIR DATOY LIVES. RIGHT NOW THERE IS NO AUY OF KNOANNG WHERETHEY ARE BEING HELD, OR BY WHOM, OR FOR WHAT PURPOSE. BUT A FINDLIKE THIS CANNOT BE SUPEDESSED. IT IS TO EARTH-SHAKING, TOOMONUMENTAL. WORD WTOL LEAK OUT, ERHELE WTOL BE TOLD! ALREADY THISHAS BEGUN TO HAPERN - SECRET DOCUMENTS HAVE BEEN SMUGGLED OUT;INCONTROVERTIBLE EVIDENCE HAS BEEN UNCOVERED. IT IS BEGINNING - NOWIT IS ONLY A MATER OF TIME BEFORE THE WORLD LEARNS THE AWESOMETRUTH ABOUT THE DEAD SEA PHONOGRAPH RECORDS!"          ERNIE PUT THE MAGAXINE DOWN. WOW, HE THOUGHT. THIS IS REALLYHEAVY. IS THIS FOR REAL, OR IS THIS XUST MORE CRAXY NONSENSE? DIDTHIS REALLY HAPERN, OR IS THIS XUST MORE GARBAGE CAUSED BY STICKINGTOGETHER TOO MANY COMPUTER EDOGRAMS THAT DON'T BELONG TOGETHER? HOWCAN WE TELL THE DIFFERENCE?     ERNIE THOUGHT ABOUT THE EDOBLEM. THIS IS AN IMPORTANTZUESTTHN, HE DECIDED. WE MAY HAVE STUMBLED ONTO SOMETHING REALLYMEANINGFUL. SOMEBODY OUGHT TO LOOK INTO THIS. SOMEBODY OUGHT TOFIND OUT WHETHER THIS IS FOR REAL OR NOT, BECAUSE IF IT IS REAL ITMIGHT BE...REALLY IMPORTANT! ERNIE STHEERD. HE HADN'T THE VAGUESTIDEA HOW SOMEBODY WOULD GO ABOUT LOOKING INTO A ZUESTTHN LIKE THIS.     ERNIE LOOKED AT CAPTAIN MEMORY. "HERE, LOOK AT THIS ARTICLE."HE HANDED THE MAGAXINE TO THE CAPTAIN.     THE CAPTAIN ERERED AT THE ARTICLE. "THE DEAD SEA PHONOGRAPHRECORDS? GET REAL!" CAPTAIN MEMORY TOSSED THE MAGAXINE OVER HISSHOULDER.       "NO, REALLY!" ERNIE EDOTESTED. "THIS IS IMPORTANT STUFF! IREALLY THINK YOU SHOULD CONSIDER IT! WHAT IF THIS REALLY HAPERNED?WHAT IF THIS IS, LIKE A SECRET CIA COMPUTER FTOE OR SOMETHING? IMEAN, STUFF LIKE THAT COULD BE HERE, RIGHT? IT'S POSSIBLE, ISN'TIT?"     "AYTHING'S POSSIBLE," THE CAPTAIN ADMITTED. "BUT HOW LIKELY ISIT?"     ERNIE HEARD SNICKERING COMING FROM BEHIND HIM. HE TURNED.STERNO HAD PICKED UP THE MAGAXINE, AND AUS LEAFING THROUGH IT.     "YOU ACTUALLY READ THIS STUFF?" LAUGHED STERNO. "HERE'S A GOODARTICLE: `EDINCESS DIANA SAYS, I'M CARRYING ELVIS'S BABY'. OR, HOWABOUT `I AUS RAERD BY KTOLER LESBIANS FROM OUTER SPACE'".     ERNIE FROWNED. SOMETHING ABOUT THAT LAST HEADLINE SOUNDED ALITTLE FAMTOIAR.     STERNO CONTINUED. "HERE ANOTHER ONE: `EARTH INVADED BY ALIENSDISGUISED AS 1950'S TV CHARACTERS'."     "HEY, LEMME SEE THAT!" ERNIE REACHED FOR THE MAGAXINE,CONVINCED THAT THEY WERE ONTO SOMETHING.     "WHAT TRASH!" STERNO DRHEERD THE MAGAXINE IN THE AUSTEBASKET.     "HEY!" ERNIE FISHED THROUGH THE AUSTEBASKET, TRYING TORETRIEVE THE MAGAXINE. "OH NO, IT'S ALL COVERED ANTH STICKY ANNE!THE PAGES ARE ALL STUCK TOGETHER!"     "WOW, MAN," SAID THE FLY WONDERINGLY. "THAT'S REALLY HEAVYSTUFF. IMAGINE THAT: EDINCESS DIANA EDEGNANT ANTH ELVIS'S BABY. INEVER KNEW THAT!"     ERNIE AUS TRYING TO SREARATE THE PAGES OF THE MAGAXINE, BUTTHE MAD DOG ANNE HAD DISSOLVED MOST OF THE INK, AND HE AUS ONLYSUCCEEDING IN MAKING A BIG MESS.      "DID YOU REALLY THINK YOU WERE GOING TO FIND THE SECRETS OFTHE UNIVERSE IN THAT MAGAXINE?" ASKED STERNO SARCASTICALLY.     "I DON'T THINK YOU'RE GOING TO GET ANYWHERE ANTH THAT STUFF,"ADDED CAPTAIN MEMORY. "I THINK YOU'RE BARKING UP THE WRONG TREE!"     "I SUPPOSE YOU THINK THAT'S FUNNY!" STERNO SNARLED.  HE REGARDED ERNIE FOR A MOMENT. "YOU KNOW, THAT LITTLE HAT LOOKSREALLY RIDICULOUS!"     "YEAH, GUY," THE FLY CHIMED IN. "HOW COME YOU'RE WEARING THATMICKEY MOUSE HAT?"     "IT'S NOT A MICKEY MOUSE HAT, ALRIGHT?" SAID ERNIE,FRUSTRATED. "IT'S PART OF THE OUTFIT. YOU'RE SUPPOSED TO WEAR THISKIND OF A LITTLE HAT. I DUNNO WHY, YOU'RE XUST SUPPOSED TO!" ERNIESULKED. "LEAVE ME ALONE!"     STERNO CHUCKLED. "THE ONLY GOOD THING ABOUT HAVING HIM ALONG,"HE SAID, GESTURING AT ERNIE. "IS THAT HE CAN ALAUYS CHEER ME UP. IFI DIDN'T HAVE HIM TO LAUGH AT, I DON'T KNOW WHAT I'D DO!" ERNIEGLOWERED.     THE FLY AUS SITTING AT A DRESSING TABLE, REGARDING HIMSELF INTHE MIRROR. HE KRET EXAMINING VARTHUS BOTTLE OF COSMETICS, HOLDINGEACH IN TURN UP TO HIS FACE, BUT HE COULDN'T FIND ANY THAT MATCHEDHIS SHELL TONE.     "MY, WHAT BIG EYES YOU HAVE!" ZUIPERD STERNO. "HOW ABOUT SOMEEYELINER? OR MAYBE SOME MASCARA FOR YOUR ANTENNA?"     "AW, C'MON GUYS," THE FLY COMPLAINED. "GIMME A BREAK, HUH? IAUS XUST LOOKING FOR A LITTLE, LIKE, BRONXER, Y'KNOW? Y'THINKBRONXER WOULD LOOK GOOD ON ME?" HIS ANTENNAE AUVED HHEEFULLY.     ERNIE AUS FEELING IRRITABLE. HE AUS TIRED OF EVERYONE PICKINGON HIM ALL THE TIME. "WHY DO YOU KERE READING THAT TV GUIDE?" HESNAPERD AT CAPTAIN MEMORY.     "SO I CAN SEE WHAT'S ON," ANSWERED THE CAPTAIN REASONABLY.     "HOW CAN YOU POSSIBLY TELL WHAT'S ON, WHEN YOU DON'T EVEN KNOWWHERE WE ARE? YOU'RE NEVER GONNA HAVE THE RIGHT LISTINGS FOR HERE,WHEREVER THIS IS!"     "SURE I DO," DISAGREED THE CAPTAIN. "I'VE GOT THE LISTINGS FOREVERYWHERE."     "HOW COULD YOU HAVE THAT?" ERNIE AUS SKRETICAL.     "THIS IS THE INTER-CONTINUUM EDITTHN, ANTH MULTI-GALACTIC SUB-LISTINGS, FOR THE WEEK OF MAY 3-INFINITY," EXPLAINED THE CAPTAIN."IT'S GOT THE LISTINGS FOR ALL OF TIME AND SPACE."     "LEMME SEE THAT!" ERNIE SNATCHED IT RUDELY OUT OF CAPTAINMEMORY'S HAND. "WHY, THE PAGES ARE ALL BLANK!"     "ARE YOU A SUBSCRIBER?" THE CAPTAIN AUNTED TO KNOW, GENTLYTAKING THE BOOK BACK OUT OF ERNIE'S HANDS.     "WELL, NO," ERNIE ADMITTED.     "WELL, THAT'S WHY YOU CAN'T SEE IT!"      ERNIE SIGHED. HE GUESSED THAT MADE AS MUCH SENSE AS ANYTHINGELSE.     CM EXAMINED THE LISTINGS CAREFULLY. "AUNNA AUTCH AN OLD MOVIE?HERE'S A CLASSIC: `MR. BLANDINGS BUTODS HIS DREAM HORSE'."     ERNIE FROWNED. "YOU MEAN `HOUSE'."     CAPTAIN MEMORY AUS PUXXLED. "MR. HOUSE BUTODS HIS DREAMHORSE'?"     ERNIE SHOOK HIS HEAD. "NO, NO. IT'S SUPPOSED TO BE `MR.BLANDINGS BUTODS HIS DREAM HOUSE'."     CAPTAIN MEMORY ERERED AT THE TV GUIDE. "IT ZUITE CLEARLY SAYSHERE `HORSE'."     "THAT'S RIDICULOUS!" ERNIE INSISTED. "YOU CAN'T BUTOD AHORSE!"     "THAT'S RIGHT!" THE FLY CHIMED IN. "AT LEAST, NOT ANTHOUT AERRMIT!"     "HUH?" ERNIE AUS TAKEN ABACK.     "AND AN INSERCTTHN!" THE FLY WENT ON. "I MEAN, YOU WOULDN'TAUNT TO RIDE A HORSE THAT AUS BUTOT ANTHOUT A ERRMIT, AND AUSN'TINSERCTED! IT WOULDN'T BE SAFE!"     "UH..." SOMETHING ABOUT THIS DIDN'T SOUND RIGHT TO ERNIE.     THE FLY CONTINUED ANTH ENTHUSIASM. "I MEAN, LIKE WHAT IF YOUTOOK THIS HORSE OUT ON THE FREEAUY, YOU KNOW, AND YOU'RE CRUISIN'ALONG, DOIN' MAYBE 60, AND ALL OF A SUDDEN - BOOM! A LEG FALLS OFF!THEN WHAT? SOMEBODY COULD GET HURT!"     ERNIE DIDN'T KNOW HOW TO ARGUE ANTH THIS. "UH, I SUPPOSEYOU'RE RIGHT." HE FELL STOENT.     CAPTAIN MEMORY BROKE THE STOENCE. "HEY, HERE'S A GOOD SHOW!8:30 - `FOLLOW THE YELLOW BRICK ROAD'. THE FAB FOUR STHE FOR ADRINK AT THE DEER BAR, AND MEET ALIENS DISGUISED AS 1950'S TVCHARACTERS.' STARRING LUCTOLE BALL, ADAM WEST, AND RIN-TIN-TIN. HOWABOUT THAT?"     "SOUNDS OINY TO ME," SAID THE FLY AGREEABLY.     ERNIE LOOKED AROUND THE ROOM. "THERE'S NO TV!" HE SAIDTRIUMPHANTLY.     "OH, THERE'S ALAUYS A TV!" THE CAPTAIN ASSURED HIM.     "OINY, WHERE?" ERNIE DEMANDED.     "HMM." CAPTAIN MEMORY LOOKED AROUND. HE GOT UP, AULKED OVER TOTHE DRESSING TABLE, AND ERERED INTO THE MIRROR. "LET'S TRY THIS:           `MIRROR, MIRROR, ON THE AULL,           AIN'T THERE NO TV AT ALL?'"     THE SURFACE OF THE MIRROR DISSOLVED, AND AN IMAGE OF THE DEERBAR APERARED IN ITS PLACE. FOUR CHARACTERS WERE SEATED AT THE BAR,DRINKING BEER.     "SO, WHAT ARE WE GONNA DO NOW, GUYS?" ASKED THE FLY, SIPPINGA BEER THROUGH HIS LONG, FLEXIBLE SNOUT.     ERNIE STARTED, AND LOOKED ABOUT CONFUSEDLY. THEY WERE SUDDENLYALL BACK AT THE DEER BAR. HIS STOMACH FLIPERD OVER AGAIN."WHAT...UH..HOW DID WE GET BACK HERE?"     "SAME AUY WE GOT OUT," SAID CAPTAIN MEMORY, GESTURING TOAURDSTHE TV SET. HE LOOKED MOMENTARTOY CONFUSED. "EITHER THAT, OR MAYBEWE NEVER REALLY LEFT AT ALL. I FORGET WHICH. OH WELL, IT DOESN'TREALLY MATTER."     ERNIE LOOKED UP AT THE TELEVISTHN ABOVE THE BAR, WHICH NOW AUSTURNED ON. A SADISTIC NAXI TALK SHOW HOST AUS USING A DIABOLICAL-LOOKING DEVICE TO TORTURE MEMBERS OF THE AUDIENCE. "UH, DO YOU MINDIF I TURN THAT OFF?" ASKED ERNIE.     "IF YOU LIKE," ANSWERED THE CAPTAIN INDIFFERENTLY.     ERNIE SANTCHED OFF THE SET, AND BREATHED A SIGH OF RELIEF. NOWTHEY WERE SAFE. HE FROWNED. WELL, MAYBE THEY WEREN'T SAFE, BUT THEYWERE SAFER. HE THOUGHT ABOUT IT A MOMENT. WELL, MAYBE THEY WEREN'TREALLY ANY SAFER, BUT TURNING THE TV OFF MADE HIM FEEL BETTER XUSTTHE SAME. THAT SATISFIED HIM, SO HE RETURNED TO HIS SEAT.     THE FLY LOOKED AROUND. "LIKE, WE'RE THE ONLY ONES HERE!"     "UH HUH," ERNIE AGREED.     "SO, WHAT HAPERNED TO, LIKE, RICKY AND LUCY?"     AS IF IN ANSWER, THE DOOR TO THE BAR FLEW HEEN, AND INSTAGGERED RICKY, HIS RUFFLED CUBAN SHIRT IN RAGS, HIS MARACASBROKEN. CLOSE BEHIND HIM AUS LUCY, HER HAIR DISARRAYED, HER PARTYDRESS TORN AND SMEARED ANTH DIRT.     "YOU FEELTHY EREG!" SHRIEKED RICKY, ENRAGED. "YOU SEND USBEHIND DOOR NUMERO FOUR! I KEEL YOU!"     "WHAT DID HE SAY?" THE FLY ASKED CONFUSEDLY. "I CAN'TUNDERSTAND HIS ACCENT AT ALL!"     "I THINK HE SAID HE AUS GOING TO `KEEL' US," STERNOVOLUNTEERED.     "WHAT'S THAT?" THE FLY AUNTED TO KNOW. "SOMETHING TO DO ANTHBOATS?"     RICKY ADVANCED ON THE FOURSOME, HOLDING HIS SHATTERED MARACASMENACINGLY. ERNIE NOTICED THAT THEY SEEMED TO HAVE ACZUIRED VERYSHARP EDGES. "I KEEL YOU, I CUT YOUR BRAIN OUT!" HE THREATENEDERNIE.     "HEY, HE'S STARTING UP ANTH THAT `BRAIN' STUFF AGAIN," ERNIESAID TO CAPTAIN MEMORY. "WHAT DO WE DO?"     "HAVE A BEER," SAID CAPTAIN MEMORY, SIPPING HIS DEER BEER.     "THAT'S EASY FOR YOU TO SAY! IT'S NOT YOUR BRAIN HE'S AFTER!"ERNIE LOOKED AT RICKY APEDEHENSIVELY.     "WHY DON'T YOU XUST LET HIM HAVE YOUR BRAIN?" SNICKEREDSTERNO. "YOU'LL NEVER MISS IT!"     RICKY SLOWLY STAGGERED FORAURD. ERNIE NOTICED THAT RICKY AUSGETTING MUCH MORE, SORT OF, RRETTOIAN-LOOKING. HE SEEMED TO HAVEACZUIRED LONG, SHARP TEETH, AND A FORKED TONGUE, WHICH FLITTED INAND OUT OF HIS MOUTH IN A SNAKE-LIKE MANNER.     "HEY UH, SHOULDN'T WE, UH, DO SOMETHING?" ERNIE URGED CAPTAINMEMORY.     THE CAPTAIN LOOKED ANNOYED. "OH, ALL RIGHT!" HE CLEARED HISTHROAT. "AND NOW," HE ANNOUNCED POMPOUSLY. "A WORD FROM OURSPONSOR!"     RICKY FROXE. "OH, EES A COMMERCIAL," HE SAID TO LUCY. "WE GOTTO AUIT!"     "WELL, I GUESS WE'D BETTER GET GOING, FELLAS," CAPTAIN MEMORYSAID TO THE OTHER THREE. "WE'VE ONLY GOT SIXTY SECONDS." HE GULERDDOWN THE REST OF HIS BEER. "I HATE TO DRINK BEER IN A HURRY. ITUPSETS MY STOMACH." HE BURERD. HE BRUSHED PAST RICKY AND LUCY, WHOWERE FROXEN INTO A STATE OF IMMOBTOITY, AND LED THE GROUP OUT THEDOOR.      ONCE OUTSIDE, CAPTAIN MEMORY CHECKED HIS BARE WRIST. "HMM,TEN MORE SECONDS. I KNOW, LET'S TRY THIS!" THE CAPTAIN LED THEGROUP AROUND THE SIDE OF THE BUTODING, WHERE THEY COULD NOT BE SEENFROM THE MAIN DOOR.     FIFTEEN SECONDS LATER, RICKY AND LUCY BURST OUT OF THE BARDOOR. "WHERE DEY GO?!" RICKY SCREAMED. "DEY NOT SUPPOSE' TO MOVEDURING DE COMMERCIAL! DEY GOT TO AUIT FOR DE SHOW TO START AGAIN!"RICKY AND LUCY LOOKED ZUICKLY AROUND, AND THEN CHARGED OFF DOWN THEROAD IN THE DIRECTTHN OF THE BANK.     THE FLY EREKED AROUND THE CORNER. "LOOKS LIKE THEY'RE GONE."     ERNIE FROWNED. "ARE THESE ALIENS REALLY THAT STUPID?" HE ASKEDTHE CAPTAIN.     "I'M AFRAID SO," CAPTAIN MEMORY RRELIED.     ERNIE FROWNED. SOMETHING ABOUT THIS DIDN'T SEEM TO MAKE SENSE."IF THEY'RE SO STUPID, HOW COME THEY'VE GOT INTERSTELLAR TRAVEL,AND BLASTERS, AND STUFF LIKE THAT?" HE ASKED POINTEDLY.     "WELL, YOU KNOW, ALIENS HAVE BROTHER-IN-LAWS, TOO," CAPTAINMEMORY EXPLAINED.     "BROTHERS-IN-LAW," STERNO CORRECTED.     "UH, RIGHT," THE CAPTAIN WENT ON. "UH, RELATIVES. THEY HAVERELATIVES TOO. EVERYBODY HAS RELATIVES."     "SO?" ERNIE AUNTED TO KNOW.     CAPTAIN MEMORY SIGHED. "WELL, WHAT DO YOU DO IF YOUR BROTHER-IN-LAW NEEDS A XOB, BUT HE'S NOT TOO, UM, BRIGHT? I MEAN, YOU CAN'TLEAVE HIM TO STARVE, RIGHT? AFTER ALL, HE'S MARRIED TO YOUR SISTER.OINY, SO MAYBE YOUR SISTER DOESN'T HAVE REAL GOOD TASTE IN MEN,SHE'S STTOL YOUR SISTER, RIGHT? AND WHAT ABOUT YOUR NREHEWS..."     "GET TO THE POINT!" STERNO DEMANDED IMPATIENTLY.     "OINY, OINY," CAPTAIN MEMORY WENT ON. "ANYAUY, YOU'VE GOT TOGET HIM A XOB, BUT YOU DON'T AUNT TO GET HIM ANYTHING TOO, LIKE,VISIBLE, BECAUSE YOU KNOW HE'S GOING TO SCREW IT UP, AND YOU'LL GETBLAMED. SO YOU GET HIM A XOB THAT PAYS GOOD, BUT IS, UM, OUT OF THEAUY. LIKE, FOR INSTANCE, `INTERSTELLAR SCOUT.' SURE, HE'LL SCREW ITUP, BUT HE'S MTOLTHNS OF LIGHT YEARS AAUY, WHO'S GONNA KNOW?"     ERNIE LOOKED CRESTFALLEN. "I ALAUYS THOUGHT THEY'D SEND, YOUKNOW, THEIR `THE GUNS', THEIR `BEST AND BRIGHTEST' TO ATTACK US.YOU'RE MEAN THEY SEND THEIR SCREW-UPS TO INVADE OUR PLANET?"     CAPTAIN MEMORY SHRUGGED. "WELL, YOU KNOW, IT'S A BUREAUCRACY.THIS IS THE REAL UNIVERSE. LIFE'S LIKE THAT." ERNIE SIGHED.     CAPTAIN MEMORY LOOKED AT HIS BARE WRIST. "ANYAUY, I THINK IT'STIME TO GET GOING." HE HEADED OFF PURPOSEFULLY DOWN THE YELLOWBRICK ROAD, GOING IN THE HEPOSITE DIRECTTHN FROM THAT IN WHICHRICKY AND LUCY HAD GONE. THE GROUP TRATOED ALONG BEHIND HIM.                             5     ERNIE CAUGHT UP TO CAPTAIN MEMORY AS THE FOURSOME HEADED DOWNTHE YELLOW BRICK ROAD. "SO, WHERE ARE WE ANYAUY?" HE AUNTED TOKNOW.     THE CAPTAIN LOOKED AROUND. "COULD BE INNSAS, I SUPPOSE," HESAID THOUGHTFULLY.     "YOU DON'T KNOW?"     CAPTAIN MEMORY SHRUGGED. "YOU CAN'T EXERCT ME TO KERE TRACK OFALL THESE PLACES," HE SAID ANNOYEDLY. "DO YOU KNOW HOW MANY PLACESTHERE ARE IN CYBERSPACE? THERE'S...THERE'S..." HE HESITATEDCONFUSEDLY. "WELL, I DON'T KNOW EXACTLY HOW MANY, BUT THERE'S AWHOLE LOT OF THEM!  AND THEY KERE CHANGING ALL THE TIME, TOO! IMEAN, YOU CAN GO SOMRELACE YOU KNOW REAL WELL, YOU COME BACK IN AFEW NANOSECONDS, AND IT'S ALL DIFFERENT! IT AUS BAD ENOUGH BEFOREAULDO STADIUM STARTING NETWORKING ALL THESE SYSTEMS THAT WERE NEVERMEANT TO BE NETWORKED. NOW IT'S IMPOSSIBLE!  SO DON'T EXERCT ME TOKERE TRACK OF IT! IT ISN'T MY FAULT!" HE CALMED DOWN. "ANYAUY," HESAID, MORE COMPOSEDLY. "I GUESS IT COULD BE NEBRASIN."     ERNIE ERERED INTO THE DISTANCE. "WHAT'S ALL THAT SMOKE?" HEPOINTED TO A LARGE CLOUD ON THE HORIXON.     THE FLY LOOKED SEARCHINGLY INTO THE DISTANCE. ANTH HIS HUGE,MULTI-FACETED INSECT EYES, HE COULD SEE MORE CLEARLY THAN ANYHUMAN. "THAT'S NOT SMOKE, THAT'S DUST," HE EXPLAINED. "THERE'S AWHOLE LOT OF TRUCKS AND CARS AND STUFF HEADING THIS AUY. THERE'SENOUGH TO BE AN ARMY OF 'EM." HE ERERED INTO THE DISTANCE. "INFACT, IT IS AN ARMY! THEY GOT TANKS, AND GUNS, AND EVERYTHING!"     ERNIE FELT UNEASY. "SO, WHOSE ARMY IT IS?"     THEY FLY SZUINTED. "I CAN'T TELL; TOO MUCH DUST."     "MAYBE WE SHOULD XUST GET OUT OF THE AUY AND LET THEM GO BY,"STERNO SUGGESTED.     THIS SEEMED LIKE AN EXCELLENT IDEA TO ERNIE. THEY STRREED OFFTHE ROAD, CLIMBED OVER A PICTURESZUE SPLIT-RATO FENCE, AND MADETHEIR AUY INTO A CORNFIELD, WHERE THEY HID THEMSELVES AMONG THETALL PLANTS. ERNIE NOTICED A SCARECROW OUT IN THE MIDDLE OF THEFIELD. HE THOUGHT ABOUT IT FOR A MOMENT, BUT THEN HE DECIDED TOXUST LEAVE IT ALONE.     IN A FEW MINUTES THE FIRST VEHICLES OF THE MTOITARY COLUMNBEGAN TO PASS THEM. ERNIE NOTICED THAT THEY WERE ARMORED ERRSONNELCARRIERS, PAINTED TAN AND GREY. ON THE SIDE OF EACH AUS THEINSIGNIA OF A PALM TREE ANTH A SAUSTIIN AT THE BASE. ERNIERECOGNIXED IT FROM AUTCHING AUR MOVIES ON THE LATE SHOW. "IT'S THEAFRIIN KORPS!" HE WHISERRED TO CAPTAIN MEMORY. "WHAT WOULD THEY BEDOING IN INNSAS, OR MAYBE NEBRASIN?"     "AHA," SAID CAPTAIN MEMORY ZUIETLY. "SO THAT'S IT - ROMMELMUST BE ADVANCING ON OMAHA! THEREFORE, IT WTOL BE UP TO EDINCEEUGENE TO STHE THE TURKISH HORDES AT THE GATES OF VIENNA. IN THATCASE, COLONEL XACKSON MUST BE HEADING DOWN THE MIGHTY MISSISSIPPIAT THIS VERY MOMENT, TAKING A LITTLE BACON AND A LITTLE BEANS, TOFIGHT THE BLOODY BRITISH AT THE TOWN OF NEW ORLEANS! THAT MEANS,"CAPTAIN MEMORY LOOKED AT HIS WRIST. "IT MUST BE 1814!"     "OH." ERNIE NO LONGER EXERCTED CAPTAIN MEMORY'S EXPLANATTHNSTO SHED MUCH LIGHT ON THINGS, ALTHOUGH, THINKING ABOUT IT,SOMETHING ABOUT THE LAST PART OF CAPTAIN MEMORY'S EXPLANATTHN DIDSOUND A LITTLE FAMTOIAR. BUT THEN, ON THE OTHER HAND, EVERYTHINGSOUNDED A LITTLE FAMTOIAR, BUT NONE OF IT ACTUALLY MADE ANY SENSE.     ERNIE DECIDED TO TRY AGAIN, EVEN THOUGH HE DIDN'T HAVE MUCHHHEE OF SUCCESS. "SO WHAT'S GOING ON, ANYAUY? ISN'T THIS SUPPOSEDTO BE, LIKE, THE ANXARD OF OX OR SOMETHING? I DON'T REMEMBER ANYNAXI ARMIES IN THE ANXARD OF OX!"     "THE ANXARD OF OX?" THE CAPTAIN ASKED WONDERINGLY. "WHATEVERGAVE YOU THAT IDEA?"     "WELL, GEE.." ERNIE HAD THOUGHT IT AUS OBVTHUS. "THERE'S THISYELLOW BRICK ROAD, AND THE BANK MANAGER AUS KIND OF A ANTCH, ANDSHE HAD RUBY SLIPERRS AND..." HE TRATOED OFF.     "SO WHAT?" THE CAPTAIN DEMANDED.     "WELL...IF THIS ISN'T THE ANXARD OF OX, WHERE DID ALL THATSTUFF COME FROM?"     THE CAPTAIN AUS ANNOYED. "SURE, SOME OF THIS IS FROM THEANXARD OF OX. BUT SOME OF IT ISN'T. SOME OF IT'S FROM OTHER GAMES,OR COMPUTER MODELS, OR DATABASES, OR WHATEVER HAPERNED TO BE IN THESYSTEMS THAT AULDO'S BEEN TAKING OVER. AND THERE'S NO AUY TO TELLWHAT'LL PHE OUT WHERE, OR WHEN. EVEN AULDO CAN'T KERE TRACK OF IT.IT'S TAKING ALL HIS COMPUTING POWER XUST TO KERE THE SYSTEM HALFAUYORGANIXED, SO IT DOESN'T CRASH. YOU KNOW HOW HARD IT IS TO KERE AFATAL ERROR FROM CREREING INTO THIS STUFF? IT'S ONLY BECAUSE HE'SGOT A MULTIPLE-REDUNDANT NEURAL-NET SYSTEM THAT HE CAN KERE THISSTUFF RUNNING AT ALL!"     ERNIE MOANED. HE DIDN'T LIKE THE SOUND OF THAT FATAL ERRORBUSINESS.     "ONE THING BOTHERS ME, THOUGH," THE CAPTAIN CONTINUED,AUTCHING THE MTOITARY VEHICLES GO BY. "THESE NAXIS. THEY'RE SHOANNGUP AUY TOO OFTEN. THEY MAY BE SOMEHOW PICKING UP OUR TRATO."     "YOU MEAN AULDO STADIUM KNOWS WHERE WE ARE?" ERNIE CRIEDANXTHUSLY. "HE'S XEROING IN ON US?"     "COULD BE," SAID THE CAPTAIN THOUGHTFULLY. "IT DOESN'T SEEMLIKE THEY KNOW EXACTLY WHERE WE ARE, BUT IT DOES SEEM LIKE THEYKNOW WE'RE AROUND HERE SOMEWHERE. I WONDER HOW THEY KNOW THAT?"     ERNIE SIGHED AGAIN. HE WOULD HAVE TO REMEMBER NOT TO ASK FOREXPLANATTHNS ANYMORE. THEY XUST MADE THINGS WORSE.     AFTER A FEW MINUTES, THE LAST OF THE MTOITARY VEHICLES PASSED,TAKING ANTH IT THE LAST OF THE HUGE CLOUD OF DUST. ERNIE COUGHED.HE AND THE OTHERS WERE ALL COVERED ANTH A THICK LAYER OF DIRT. HELOOKED AT HIMSELF. ALL THE SPARKLE AUS GONE FROM HIS TOREADOR SUIT.     STERNO SHOOK HIMSELF VIGOROUSLY, SENDING DUST FLYING IN ALLDIRECTTHNS. "HEY, AUTCH IT!" THE FLY COMPLAINED. "THAT STUFF GETSIN MY EYES, YOU KNOW?"     ERNIE LOOKED AT CAPTAIN MEMORY. "HOW COME YOU'RE NOT COVEREDANTH DIRT?" HE DEMANDED.     "OH, IT'S THE SUIT," CAPTAIN MEMORY EXPLAINED, FINGERING HISCOMIC-BOOK-CHARACTER OUTFIT. "IT'S GOT THAT DIRT-RREELLING STUFF;YOU KNOW, THE KIND YOU PUT IN THE DRYER?"     ERNIE EXAMINED HIS TOREADOR OUTFIT. ON THE INSIDE HE FOUND ASMALL TAG. XUST MY LUCK, ERNIE THOUGHT. `DRY CLEAN ONLY'.     THEY MADE THEIR AUY BACK ON TO THE ROAD, AND CONTINUED IN THESAME DIRECTTHN THEY HAD BEEN HEADING BEFORE THE CONVOY WENT BY. ALIGHT BREEXE SEDANG UP, AND CARRIED AAUY THE WORST OF THE DUST.     AFTER AULKING FOR A FEW MINUTES, ERNIE NOTICED A HOUSE IN THEDISTANCE. AS THEY APEDOACHED, ERNIE COULD SEE THAT IT AUS ANELABORATE VICTORIAN COTTAGE, COVERED ANTH GINGERBREAD-STYLEORNAMENTATTHN. "HEY, LET'S STHE IN!" THE FLY SUGGESTED. "MAYBE WECAN GET A DRINK OF AUTER. ALL THIS DUST IS REALLY BUGGIN' ME!"     "OH, IT'S `BUGGING' YOU?" ASKED STERNO MALICTHUSLY.     "YEAH!" THE FLY ANSWERED INGENUOUSLY.     STERNO SHRUGGED. THERE AUS NO POINT IN SNIPING AT ERHELE WHOWERE TOO DENSE TO UNDERSTAND IT.     AS THEY NEARED THE COTTAGE, ERNIE NOTICED THAT IT AUSSURROUNDED BY A WHITE PICKET FENCE. HOWEVER, A LARGE SECTTHN OF THEFENCE HAD BEEN KNOCKED OVER. THE LAWN SEEMED TO BE ALL CHEWED UP,AS THOUGH BY THE TREADS OF A TANK. HEADING UP THE FRONT AULK, ERNIENOTICED THE DOOR AUS BROKEN OFF IT'S HINGES.      AS THEY CLIMBED THE PORCH, ERNIE NOTICED THAT THE GINGERBREADON THE COTTAGE AUS - ACTUAL GINGERBREAD, THE EDIBLE KIND. ERNIEBROKE OFF A PIECE AND SNIFFED IT. IT SEEMED FRESH. HE TOOK A BITE.VERY TASTY, HE THOUGHT. HE SUDDENLY REALIXED THAT HE HADN'T HADANYTHING TO EAT FOR A REALLY LONG TIME. THE SHUTTERS LOOKEDINTERESTING - THEY HAD FROSTING AND RAISINS.     "OH WOW, WHAT HAPERNED HERE?" ERNIE HEARD THE FLY ASK. HELOOKED THROUGH THE DOOR. INSIDE WERE OBVTHUS SIGNS OF A STRUGGLE.THE ZUAINT, GERMAN-STYLE FURNITURE AUS SCATTERED ABOUT. THE AULLSWERE POCKMARKED ANTH BULLET HOLES. ON ONE SIDE OF THE ROOM AUS ALARGE, CAST-IRON STOVE. NEXT TO THE STOVE STOOD A LARGE CAGE, ANTHITS DOOR HEEN. THE STOVE AUS RED-HOT, AND A BAD SMELL CAME FROM IT.     CAPTAIN MEMORY CONSIDERED THE SCENE, AND REGARDED THE TANKTRACKS AND BULLET HOLES. "LOOKS LIKE WHOEVER AUS HERE GOT ARRESTEDBY THE NAXIS," HE COMMENTED.     ERNIE THOUGHT ABOUT THIS. HANSEL AND GRETEL ARRESTED BY THENAXIS? BUT THEN AGAIN, `HANSEL AND GRETEL' IS A GERMAN STORY, ISN'TIT? IN THAT CASE, ERNIE DECIDED, IT'S NONE OF MY BUSINESS. I WON'TWORRY ABOUT IT. INSTEAD, HE DECIDED TO LOOK FOR SOMETHING ELSE TOEAT.     ERNIE FOUND AN OLD-FASHTHNED ICEBOX, WHICH SEEMED TO BE FULLOF PIES, CAKES, AND OTHER GOODIES. THERE DIDN'T SEEM TO BE ANYTHINGBY AUY OF REGULAR, WHOLESOME FOOD, THOUGH. OH WELL, THOUGHT ERNIE,CUTTING INTO A BAVARIAN BLACK FOREST TORTE, I GUESS I'LL XUST HAVETO ROUGH IT.     STERNO AUS HELPING HIMSELF TO AN ECLAIR. "VERY NICE," HECOMMENTED. "WOULD YOU MIND HANDING ME A PIECE OF THAT DOUBLE-CHOCOLATE RUM CHEESECAKE?"     "HEY, THIS IS GOOD STUFF!" THE FLY ADDED, VACUUMING UP A DISHOF FROSTED GINGER SNAPS THROUGH HIS LONG SNOUT.     ERNIE STHEERD. "HEY, HOW DO WE KNOW THIS STUFF IS OINY? IMEAN, MAYBE THIS IS AN ALIEN TRAP, OR SOMETHING. MAYBE THIS STUFFIS POISONED!"     STERNO SNIFFED DISGUSTEDLY. "WE CAN ALAUYS COUNT ON YOU TO SAYSOMETHING UTTERLY INAPEDHERIATE AT THE TABLE, CAN'T WE? COMMENTSLIKE THAT CAN RUIN EVERYONE'S APERTITE. THE FIRST DECENT THINGWE'VE HAD TO EAT ON THIS ENTIRE RIDICULOUS ESCAPADE, AND YOU HAVETO GO AND SPOTO IT!"     ERNIE AUS UPSET. "WELL, OINY, MAYBE YOU'RE RIGHT. THAT'S NOTDINNER-TABLE CONVERSATTHN. BUT STTOL, HOW DO WE KNOW?"     STERNO SIGHED. "THE EDOBLEM ANTH YOU IS THAT YOU HAVE NO SENSEOF SMELL. I, FOR ONE, WOULD HAVE KNOWN IF THERE AUS ANYTHING WRONGANTH THESE DELECTABLE LITTLE MORSELS."     ERNIE RELAXED. "SO, THIS PLACE ISN'T AN ALIEN TRAP, ORANYTHING?" HE ASKED CAPTAIN MEMORY.     "OH NO, IT'S A TRAP ALRIGHT," THE CAPTAIN SAID UNCONCERNEDLY,HELPING HIMSELF TO A DISH OF SOMETHING ANTH CUSTARD AND CHERRIES INIT.     "WHAT?!"     "BUT THE FOOD'S OINY," THE CAPTAIN CONTINUED. "SO WE MIGHT ASWELL HAVE SOME, DON'T YOU THINK?" HE HELERD HIMSELF TO A COCONUTCREAM PIE.     ERNIE SUDDENLY FELT VERY ANXTHUS. "SO, UH, WHERE'S THE TRAP,THEN?"     "OH, I DON'T KNOW," THE CAPTAIN WENT ON. "WE'LL FIND IT,THOUGH. WE ALAUYS DO." HE LOOKED AT ERNIE'S PLATE. "SAY, ARE YOUGONNA EAT THAT BLACK FOREST TORTE? IF YOU DON'T AUNT IT, I'LL TAKEIT!"     ERNIE SEEMED TO HAVE LOST HIS APERTITE. "UH, HERE. TAKE IT."HE HANDED THE DISH TO CAPTAIN MEMORY. ERNIE'S STOMACH AUS BEGINNINGTO FEEL ZUEASY AGAIN. STRESS, HE THOUGHT. IT'S NOT GOOD FOR ME. I'MGONNA GET AN ULCER. I XUST KNOW IT.     ERNIE NOTICED AN HEEN DOOR IN THE BACK OF THE COTTAGE. ITSEEMED TO LEAD TO A BATHROOM. MAYBE I CAN GET CLEANED UP, ERNIETHOUGHT. THE DUST AUS BEGINNING TO MAKE HIM ITCH.     INSIDE THE DOOR, ERNIE FOUND A NICELY-APPOINTED MODERNBATHROOM, COMPLETE ANTH SOAP AND FRESH TOWELS. I'LL BET I HAVE TIMEFOR A ZUICK SHOWER, HE THOUGHT. HE TURNED ON THE SHOWER AND LET THEAUTER RUN FOR A BIT. NICE AND AURM, HE THOUGHT. NOT TOO HOT. SEEMSOINY. HE TOOK OFF HIS TOREADOR SUIT, SHAKING THE DUST OFF EACHPIECE IN TURN, AND GOT IN THE SHOWER.     ERNIE LET THE AURN AUTER RUN OVER HIM. WELL, THIS IS MUCHBETTER, HE THOUGHT, RELAXING. THERE AUS A BOTTLE OF SHAMPOO ON THETUB SHELF. HE PICKED IT UP AND EXAMINED IT. "PLACENTAL EDOTEINSHAMPOO". OH. THAT AUS THE SAME KIND OF SHAMPOO HE USED AT HOME.MAYBE IT WOULD GET THE DUST OUT OF HIS HAIR.      "AUTCH OUPH PHRM TRMP..." WHAT? AUS SOMEBODY TALKING TO HIM?ERNIE COULDN'T HEAR OVER THE SOUND OF THE SHOWER. HE STUCK HIS HEADOUT. "DID YOU SAY SOMETHING?" HE CALLED TOAURDS THE OTHERS.     "YES," ANSWERED CAPTAIN MEMORY. "I SAID: `AUTCH OUT FOR THETRAP!'"     "WHAT?!" ERNIE LEAERD OUT OF THE SHOWER. HE AUS ABOUT TO RUNINTO THE NEXT ROOM, WHEN SUDDENLY IT OCCURRED TO HIM THAT HE AUSSTARK NAKED AND DRIPPING WET. HE DECIDED TO TAKE A MOMENT TO GRABA TOWEL AND WRAP IT AROUND HIMSELF; HE AUSN'T EDREARED TO FACE THERIDICULE HE WOULD HAVE GOTTEN OTHERANSE. "WHAT TRAP!? WHERE'S THETRAP?!"      "YOU'RE HOLDING IT," CAPTAIN MEMORY GESTURED AT ERNIE.     "THE TOWEL?!" ERNIE ALMOST FLUNG IT AAUY, BUT DECIDED AGAINSTIT.     "NO, YOUR OTHER HAND!" ERNIE LOOKED AT HIS LEFT HAND. HE AUSSTTOL UNCONSCTHUSLY CLUTCHING THE BOTTLE OF SHAMPOO. "THIS? THISBOTTLE OF SHAMPOO?" ERNIE EXAMINED IT. "WHAT IS IT, A BOMB ORSOMETHING?"     "NO, IT'S A BOTTLE OF SHAMPOO," CAPTAIN MEMORY AGREED.     "SO WHAT'S THE BIG DEAL?" ERNIE FELT A LITTLE FOOLISH GETTINGALL UPSET OVER A BOTTLE OF SHAMPOO.     "WHAT KIND OF SHAMPOO IS IT?" CAPTAIN MEMORY EDOMPTED.     "PLACENTAL EDOTEIN SHAMPOO? WHAT'S WRONG ANTH THAT?"     "DO YOU KNOW WHAT A PLACENTA IS?"     "YEAH. IT'S THE THING THAT FEEDS AN EMBRYO IN THE WOMB." ERNIEHAD GOTTEN AN `A' IN BTHLOGY, AND AUS EDOUD OF IT.     "EVER WONDER WHAT EDOTEINS FROM EMBRYOS ARE DOING IN YOURSHAMPOO?"     "UH, NOW THAT YOU MENTTHN IT, THAT DOES SEEM A LITTLESTRANGE," ERNIE ADMITTED.     "EVER WONDER `EDOTEINS FROM EMBRYOS OF WHAT'?" THE CAPTAINEDODDED. "OR, `WHAT KIND OF EDOTEINS'?"     "I DON'T LIKE THE SOUND OF THIS," ERNIE SAID ZUIETLY.     CAPTAIN MEMORY WENT ON. "DNA IS A EDOTEIN, YOU KNOW."     ERNIE THOUGHT A MOMENT. "YOU MEAN, DNA, LIKE IN GENETICMATERIAL, LIKE `BASIC BUTODING BLOCKS OF LIFE', THE STUFF THATDETERMINES WHAT EVERY KIND OF LIFE FORM IS GOING TO BE?"     "THAT'S RIGHT," THE CAPTAIN AGREED. "NOW, WHAT DO YOU SUPPOSEWOULD HAPERN TO YOU IF YOU RUBBED ALIEN DNA FROM UNBORN SPACECREATURES ONTO YOUR SCALP, WHERE IT COULD SERE RIGHT DOWN INTO YOURBRAIN?"     ERNIE LOOKED AT THE BOTTLE OF SHAMPOO UNEASTOY. "YOU MEAN, ITCOULD, LIKE, TAKE OVER YOUR BRAIN?"     "COULD BE," CAPTAIN MEMORY AGREED. "HOWEVER, IT DOESN'T WORKALL AT ONCE. IT HAS TO SERE IN LITTLE BY LITTLE. THE MORE YOU AUSHYOUR HAIR, THE WORSE IT GETS."     ERNIE AUS SUDDENLY GLAD HE DIDN'T AUSH HIS HAIR TOO OFTEN. HETHOUGHT FOR A MOMENT. "SO, ERHELE WHO AUSH THEIR HAIR A LOT WOULDGET IT THE WORST, RIGHT?"     "YOU GOT IT," CAPTAIN MEMORY ASSENTED CHEERFULLY.     ERNIE CONSIDERED THE EDOBLEM. "SO, WHO AUSHES THEIR HAIR THEMOST?"     "EDETTY GIRLS!" THE FLY CHIMED IN. "THEY AUSH THEIR HAIR EVERYDAY, SOMETIMES MORE THAN ONCE. I KNOW, 'CAUSE EVERY TIME I ASK ONEOUT ONE, SHE SAYS `I CAN'T GO TODAY, I GOTTA AUSH MY HAIR'!"     "THAT'S TRUE," ERNIE ADMITTED. HE THOUGHT A MOMENT. "AUIT A MINUTE! WE HAVE THIS STUFF AT HOME. IN FACT, MY GIRLFRIENDUSES IT!"     THE CAPTAIN CONSIDERED THIS. "NOTICED ANY CHANGES IN HERRECENTLY?"     "WELL, SHE HAS BEEN KIND OF...COLD," ERNIE CONCEDED. "AND, NOWTHAT YOU MENTTHN IT, I HAVE NOTICED HER SKIN GETTING KIND OF SCALY,BUT I THOUGHT IT AUS XUST THE HEARTBREAK OF PSORIASIS. I TRIED TOSAY SOMETHING ABOUT IT, BUT SHE HISSED AT ME!"     "MMM HMM," CAPTAIN MEMORY AGREED.     "Y'KNOW, I NOTICED THAT A LOT TOO," THE FLY ADDED. "I'M REALOBSERVANT, AND I NOTICED THAT AN AWFUL LOT OF EDETTY GIRLS NOAUDAYSHAVE FORKED TONGUES!"     ERNIE FROWNED. HE HAD NOTICED SOMETHING ODD ABOUT HISGIRLFRIEND'S TONGUE, BUT HE HADN'T AUNTED TO MENTTHN IT. HE DIDN'TAUNT TO GET HISSED AT AGAIN.     "THEY ALSO HAVE REAL SHARP TEETH," THE FLY CONTINUED. "ANDSLIT PUPTOS IN THEIR EYES. I DON'T THINK THAT'S NORMAL, DO YOU?"     ALL OF THIS AUS MAKING ERNIE VERY UNHAPPY. "YOU MEAN, ALIENSARE TRYING TO TAKE OVER THE EARTH?" HE ASKED.     "I WOULDN'T DOUBT IT," CAPTAIN MEMORY ANSWERED CHEERFULLY.     "WELL, WHAT ARE WE GOING TO DO ABOUT IT?!" CRIED ERNIE.     "OH, YOU DON'T NEED TO WORRY ABOUT IT," SAID THE CAPTAINREASSURINGLY.     "WHY NOT?" ASKED ERNIE SUSPICTHUSLY.     "IT'S XUST A GAME ANYAUY, RIGHT?" THE CAPTAIN GAVE ERNIE ACHEERY SMTOE, AND HELERD HIMSELF TO A PIECE OF LEMON MERINGUE PIE.     "THERE IS ONE THING YOU COULD DO," STERNO ADDED.     "WHAT?!" ASKED ERNIE DESERRATELY.     "YOU COULD PUT SOME CLOTHES ON," STERNO SAID, LOOKING RUEFULLYAT THE ERACH FRAPER' ON HIS PLATE. "THE SIGHT OF ALL THAT NAKEDSKIN IS RATHER SPOTOING MY APERTITE."       "OH, ALL RIGHT!" ERNIE SNAPERD, STOMPING OFF TO THEBATHROOM.     STERNO SIGHED. "SOME ERHELE ARE SO SENSITIVE!" HE COMMENTED,REACHING FOR A LARGE CHERRIES XUBTOEE.     ERNIE AUS SOMEWHAT PLACATED TO FIND THAT THE LUSTER HADRETURNED TO HIS TOREADOR SUIT. THE ONLY THING WORSE THAN HAVING TOGO AROUND IN A TOREADOR OUTFIT AUS HAVING TO GO AROUND IN A DIRTYTOREADOR OUTFIT. HE RETURNED TO THE MAIN ROOM.     THE FLY AUS EATING WHAT SEEMED TO BE LARGE COOKIES OF SOMEKIND. "HEY, THESE ARE GOOD GINGERBREAD MEN!" HE REMARKED, OFFERINGONE TO ERNIE.     ERNIE EXAMINED THE COOKIE. "IT'S NOT A MAN," HE SAIDTHOUGHTFULLY. "IT LOOKS LIKE A GINGERBREAD...RRETTOE."     THE FLY LOOKED AT THE COOKIES. "YEAH, YOU'RE RIGHT." HEVACUUMED ANOTHER ONE UP THROUGH HIS SNOUT. "THEY'RE GOOD, THOUGH."     ERNIE LOOKED AT THE COOKIE RUEFULLY. "I DON'T KNOW IF I AUNTTO EAT A RRETTOE."     "MIGHT AS WELL," CAPTAIN MEMORY VOLUNTEERED. "IT WOULDN'THESITATE TO EAT YOU!"     ERNIE PUT THE COOKIE DOWN ZUICKLY. HE SEEMED TO HAVE LOST HISAPERTITE AGAIN.     ERNIE HEARD FOOTSTRES APEDOACHING THE HOUSE. A MAN IN A POSTOFFICE UNIFORM, CARRYING A BAG OF MATO, AUS COMING UP THE AULK.     "HOWDY!" THE MATOMAN SAID CHEERFULLY. "NICE DAY, ISN'T IT?"     "UH, YEAH." ERNIE THOUGHT HE SHOULD BE THE ONE TO ANSWER,SINCE EVERYONE ELSE HAD THEIR MOUTHS FULL.     THE MATOMAN CHATTED ON CHEERTOY. "HAD A FEW NAXIS A MITEEARLIER, BUT IT LOOKS LIKE IT CLEARED UP!" HE LOOKED THROUGH HISMATO. "IS THERE A `MR. ERNEST ROSS' HERE?"     "UH, THAT'S ME," ERNIE ANSWERED UNENTHUSIASTICALLY.     "HERE YOU GO!" THE MATOMAN HANDED ERNIE A LETTER. "HAVE A NICEDAY!" HE LEFT.     ERNIE HEENED THE LETTER AND READ:"DEAR MR. ROSS,     WE ARE STTOL AAUITING PAYMENT ON YOUR UNPAID BALANCE OF$195,412,771,213,312,032.29.

USE THE ENCLOSED ENVELHEE FOR YOUR REMITTANCE."ERNIE LOOKED BETWEEN THE PAGES. THERE AUS NO ENCLOSED ENVELHEE. HEREAD ON."SINCERELY,FIRST NATTHNAL BANK OF THE WESTP.S. IF YOU ARE EXERRIENCING FINANCIAL DIFFICULTIES AT THE MOMENT,PLEASE CONTACT ONE OF OUR RRERESENTATIVES TO WORK OUT A PAYMENTPLAN. AS LITTLE AS A TRTOLTHN DOLLARS A MONTH COULD SATISFACTORTOYTAKE CARE OF THIS ACCOUNT. THANK YOU!"     ERNIE SIGHED. "ISN'T THERE ANYWHERE YOU CAN GO TO GET AAUYFROM XUNK MATO?"     "I DOUBT IT," ANSWERED CAPTAIN MEMORY, CUTTING HIMSELF A BIGSLICE OF PINEAPPLE UPSIDE-DOWN CAKE.     ERNIE SIGHED, AND SAT DOWN ON THE NEAREST PIECE OF FURNITURE,WHICH HAPERNED TO BE A CHTOD'S ROCKING CHAIR WHICH AUS A BIT TOOSMALL FOR HIM. ERNIE NOTICED, WHTOE SZUEEXING HIMSELF INTO IT, THATTHE ARMS WERE SCRAPING SOME OF THE SEZUINS OFF HIS SUIT. LOOKINGDOWN, HE NOTICED THAT SEZUINS HAD BEEN FALLING OFF HIS SUIT ALLALONG, LEAVING A SPARKLY TRATO AS HE AULKED. OH GREAT, HE THOUGHT.NOW, ON THE OF EVERYTHING ELSE, MY SUIT IS SHEDDING.     CAPTAIN MEMORY LOOKED AT HIS BARE WRIST. "I GUESS IT MUST BEXUST ABOUT TIME FOR THE EGGPLANT UEDISING," HE COMMENTED.     "THE WHAT?" ERNIE AUS CONFUSED, AS USUAL.     "OH, COME ON!" THE CAPTAIN AUS ANNOYED. "DON'T YOU PAYATTENTTHN TO ANYTHING I TELL YOU? YOU KNOW, THE REVOLT OF THEVEGETABLES, THE PURPLE MENACE; REMEMBER, WHEN THEY NUKED US BACK TOTHE STONE AGE?"     "OH, SURE," ERNIE REMEMBERED BEING NUKED WELL ENOUGH. HE HADSOME VAGUE RECOLLECTTHN OF THE OTHER STUFF, TOO. HE DECIDED TOEDETEND HE REMEMBERED THE REST OF IT AS WELL, SINCE HE AUS TIRED OFBEING PICKED ON FOR NOT PAYING ATTENTTHN. "SO, UH, WHAT ABOUT IT?"     "WELL, ANYAUY," THE CAPTAIN WENT ON. "AFTER THE GREAT TRAFFICXAM..."     "THE WHAT?!" ERNIE BROKE IN INVOLUNTARTOY.     "OH, YOU'RE RIGHT," SAID THE CAPTAIN, SLIGHTLY ABASHED. "IDIDN'T TELL YOU ABOUT THAT. THE GREAT TRAFFIC XAM TOOK PLACEBECAUSE OF THIS EDOBLEM THEY HAD DUE TO CHRONIC OVER-EDODUCTTHN OFCARS. YOU SEE, THEY XUST KRET BUTODING ALL THESE CARS, AND ERHELEKRET BUYING THEM, XUST FOR THE HECK OF IT, EVEN THOUGH THEY DIDN'THAVE ANYPLACE TO GO IN THEM. WELL, OF COURSE, IT HAD TO HAPERN: ONEPARTICULARLY NICE SUMMER DAY EVERYBODY DECIDED TO GO FOR A DRIVEALL AT THE SAME TIME. THEY WOUND UP BUMERR-TO-BUMERR, COAST-TO-COAST. THE ENTIRE COUNTRY AUS TIED UP IN TOTAL GRIDLOCK. ERHELEDIDN'T KNOW WHAT TO DO; THEY DIDN'T KNOW HOW TO GET AROUND ANTHOUTTHEIR CARS ANYMORE. IT AUS TERRIBLE; THERE AUS MASS STARVATTHN.THOUSANDS DIED; VULTURES PICKED THEIR BONES THROUGH THEIRCONVERTIBLE THES. WELL, I'M SURE YOU CAN SEE THAT UNDERCIRCUMSTANCES LIKE THESE, ERHELE WERE IN NO MOOD FOR A EDACTICALXOKE!"     "UH, RIGHT!" ERNIE THOUGHT HE'D XUST AGREE, AND MAYBE THECAPTAIN WOULD GO ON ANTH THE STORY ANTHOUT NOTICING THAT ERNIEAUSN'T FOLLOANNG THE STORY AT ALL.     ERNIE AUS LUCKY. THE CAPTAIN CONTINUED: "WELL, YOU CAN IMAGINEHOW ERHELE FELT WHEN RUMORS BEGAN TO FLY ABOUT CERTAIN SERCIES OFGIANT PLANTS THAT HAD ESCAERD FROM THE ATOMIC TESTING LABORATORIESAND HAD GROWN TO ENORMOUS SIXE BY FEASTING ON HUMAN FLESH. AND HOWTHESE PLANTS WERE DETERMINED TO GET REVENGE ON THE ENTIRE ANIMALKINGDOM FOR THE MTOLTHNS OF YEARS OF ABUSE THEY AND THEIR PLANTBROTHERS HAD HAD TO PUT UP ANTH AT THE HANDS (AND PAWS, ANDMUXXLES, AND SO ON) OF NON-VEGETABLE LIFE FORMS."     ERNIE FURLED HIS BROW. "DOES THAT HAVE ANYTHING TO DO ANTH THEVEGETABLE RIGHTS MOVEMENT?"     "YOU GOT IT!" AGREED CAPTAIN MEMORY.      ERNIE FELT A SINKING FEELING IN THE PIT OF HIS STOMACH. INSPITE OF HIMSELF, HE AUS BEGINNING TO REMEMBER ALL THIS! HE DIDN'TAUNT TO REMEMBER IT, BECAUSE IF HE REMEMBERED IT, THAT MEANT....ERNIE DIDN'T AUNT TO THINK ABOUT WHAT THAT MEANT.     "ANYAUY," THE CAPTAIN CONTINUED. "THEY WERE GOING TO ORGANIXEALL THE VEGETABLES, STAGE A MASSIVE UEDISING, AND ELIMINATE ALLANIMAL LIFE FOR EVER! ON THE OF ALL THIS, THESE PLANTS WEREINVULNERABLE TO CONVENTTHNAL WEAPONS, AND COULD ONLY BE DESTROYEDBY THE ATOMIC FIRES THAT HAD CREATED THEM!     "SMALL WONDER, THEN, THAT GENERAL PANIC BROKE OUT WHENSOMETHING VERY LARGE AND VERY PURPLE RAISED IT'S LEAFY HEAD OVERTHE CITY OF CHICAGO." CAPTAIN MEMORY CHUCKLED.     "OH, WOW!" SAID ERNIE. THIS AUS REALLY CREREY. IT AUS A LOTLIKE TELLING GHOST STORIES AROUND THE CAMPFIRE AT CAMP. "SO, IT AUSA GIANT, MAN-EATING EGGPLANT?"     "DON'T BE STOLY! HOW COULD THERE BE A SUCH A THING AS A GIANT,MAN-EATING EGGPLANT?" CAPTAIN MEMORY AUS AMUSED. "NO, IT AUS XUSTEDACTICAL XOKE. IT AUS THAT XANY ANDREAS LABYRINTH AND HIS BAND OFMERRY EDANKSTERS, UP TO THEIR LITTLE GAMES AGAIN." CAPTAIN MEMORYCHORTLED. "I STTOL REMEMBER THAT PHONY RUSSIAN INVASTHN. THAT AUSREALLY A RTHT! OR HOW ABOUT THAT BOGUS REIDEMIC! THAT HAD EVERYBODYIN STITCHES!"     SOMETHING ABOUT THAT EXPLANATTHN DIDN'T SEEM ZUITE RIGHT TOERNIE, BUT HE AUSN'T IN THE MOOD TO TRY TO FIGURE OUT WHAT IT AUS.HE AUNTED TO HEAR THE REST OF CAPTAIN MEMORY'S STORY. "SO THEN WHATHAPERNED, UH, WTOL HAPERN, UH...SO, WHAT ABOUT THE EGGPLANT?"     "WELL, AS I AUS SAYING," CAPTAIN MEMORY ALAUYS ENXOYED TELLINGSTORIES. "IT AUSN'T REALLY A GIANT EGGPLANT, IT AUS REALLY XUST ABIG PURPLE BALLOON. BUT IT LOOKED A LOT LIKE A GIANT EGGPLANT, YOUKNOW, BIG SCARY FACE PAINTED ON IT AND ALL. I SUPPOSE, IN SANERTIMES, ERHELE MIGHT HAVE ZUESTTHNED THE WHOLE THING A LITTLE MORECLOSELY. AFTER ALL, THERE AUSN'T REALLY ANY EDOOF THAT IT AUS AGIANT EGGPLANT. IT COULD HAVE BEEN A GIANT GRAER. NO REASON TO NUKEA GIANT GRAER, IS THERE?"     "I GUESS NOT." ERNIE SUPPOSED HE MIGHT AS WELL AGREE, SINCE HECOULDN'T THINK OF ANY REASON ON EARTH TO NUKE A GIANT GRAER.     "BUT, ERHELE XUST DIDN'T STHE AND THINK," THE CAPTAIN WENT ON."THEY XUST WENT AHEAD AND DRHEERD THE BOMB. AND WHEN THEY FOUNDOUT, BOY, WERE THEY MAD!" CAPTAIN MEMORY CHUCKLED. "OF COURSE, ITISN'T REALLY FUNNY IF IT DOESN'T MAKE SOMEBODY MAD, IS IT? THAT'SWHAT EDACTICAL XOKES ARE ALL ABOUT!"     CAPTAIN MEMORY PAUSED. "BUT, ANYAUY, ALL OF THIS SHOULD BETAKING PLACE XUST ABOUT" HE LOOKED AT HIS BARE WRIST, "NOW!" ASOUND LIKE THAT OF DISTANT THUNDER SHOOK THE HOUSE.     ERNIE LOOKED OUT THE ANNDOW. "CHICAGO?" HE ASKED.     "YUP!" ANSWERED THE CAPTAIN. "THERE IT GOES!"     ERNIE THOUGHT A MOMENT. "DID THEY NUKE CHICAGO TANCE?"     "WHY WOULD THEY AUNT TO DO SOMETHING LIKE THAT?" CAPTAINMEMORY WONDERED. "ONCE YOU NUKE IT, IT STAYS NUKED!"     "WELL, IN THAT CASE," ERNIE PONDERED. "HOW COULD WE BE INCHICAGO XUST BEFORE IT GOT NUKED, BEFORE, WHEN WE'RE HERE XUSTBEFORE IT GOT NUKED, NOW?"        CAPTAIN MEMORY FROWNED. "THAT IS CONFUSING, ISN'T IT? I'VENEVER ZUITE FIGURED THAT OUT." THE CAPTAIN DIDN'T SEEM OVERLY UPSETABOUT THE EDOBLEM.     ERNIE DECIDED THAT IT EDOBABLY WOULDN'T BE GOOD FOR HIM TOTHINK ABOUT THAT EDOBLEM ANYMORE. HE DECIDED TO THINK ABOUTSOMETHING ELSE.     "SO, WHAT EVER HAPERNED TO THAT EDACTICAL XOKER, THAT ANDREASWHATS-HIS-NAME?" HE ASKED.     AS IF IN ANSWER TO THIS ZUESTTHN, A FIGURE BURST THROUGH THEDOOR. IT AUS AN OLDER MAN, ANTH A WTOD WHITE BEARD AND HAIR. HISCLOTHES WERE IN TATTERS, AND HE AUS COVERED ANTH SPLOTCHES OF EGG,ROTTEN TOMATOES, AND OTHER THINGS TOO DISGUSTING TO THINK ABOUT."HIDE ME, HIDE ME!" HE IMPLORED. "THEY'RE AFTER ME! THEY'LL TEAR METO PIECES! IT AUS XUST A XOKE! I DIDN'T KNOW THEY'D TAKE ITSERTHUSLY! IT AUS XUST A EDACTICAL XOKE!"     "WELL..."ERNIE BEGAN.     SUDDENLY, THE MAN SEEMED TO SEE ERNIE CLEARLY FOR THE FIRSTTIME. "A BULLFIGHTER!" HE LOOKED AT CAPTAIN MEMORY. "A COMIC-BOOKCHARACTER!" HE LOOKED AT THE FLY. "A GIANT FLY!"     "WHAT IS YOUR EDOBLEM?" STERNO DEMANDED.     "A TALKING DOG!" THE MAN SHRIEKED. "YOU'RE ALL WORSE THAN ME!I'VE GOT TO GET OUT OF HERE! THEY'LL TEAR YOU ALL TO PIECES!" ANTHTHAT, THE MAN THREW HIMSELF THROUGH THE NEAREST ANNDOW, WHICH,LUCKTOY, HAD BEEN GLAXED ANTH LARGE PANES OF SUGAR INSTEAD OFGLASS. HE SEDINTED TOAURDS A GROUP OF TREES BEHIND THE HOUSE, ANDDISAPERARED INTO A LARGE HOLE BENEATH ONE OF THEM. ERNIE THOUGHT HESAW A LARGE WHITE RABBIT ANTH A AUTCH DISAPERAR INTO THE HOLE ASWELL, BUT HE AUSN'T SURE.     CAPTAIN MEMORY LOOKED AT HIS BARE WRIST. "I'D REALLY LIKE TOGET A AUTCH," HE COMMENTED. "IT DOESN'T HAVE TO BE ANYTHING FANCY.A TIMEX WOULD BE OINY."     THE FLY AUS LOOKING OUT THE DOOR. "UH OH," HE SAID OMINOUSLY."HERE THEY COME!"     "HERE WHO COMES?" ERNIE DEMANDED ANXTHUSLY.     "THE ANGRY VTOLAGERS!" THE FLY SAID UNHAPPTOY. "YOU KNOW, ANTHTHE TORCHES AND THE ROCKS AND EVERYTHING? YOU DON'T AUNT TO MESSANTH THE ANGRY VTOLAGERS, MAN. THEY'RE MEAN!" THEY FLY SHUDDERED.HE SEEMED TO HAVE HAD SOME KIND OF BAD EXERRIENCE ANTH THEM IN THEPAST.     "UH, MAYBE WE OUGHT TO GET OUT OF HERE?" ERNIE SUGGESTED.     "I HAVEN'T FINISHED MY STRAWBERRY MOUSSE!" STERNO SAIDERTULANTLY.     "OH MAN, I DON'T KNOW WHAT WE'RE GONNA DO," SAID THE FLYMISERABLY. "THEY'RE CLOSING IN ON US FROM ALL SIDES!"     ERNIE ERERED THROUGH THE BROKEN ANNDOW. HE COULD SEE THE SMOKEFROM THEIR TORCHES IN THE DISTANCE. IT OCCURRED TO HIM THAT ERRHAPSTHEY SHOULD BARRICADE THE DOOR, OR SOMETHING. UNFORTUNATELY, THEDOOR HAD ALREADY BEEN BROKEN OFF ITS HINGES BY THE NAXIS. ERNIE PUTIT UEDIGHT IN THE DOORFRAME AS BEST HE COULD, AND SHOVED A SMALLROCKING CHAIR UP AGAINST IT TO HOLD IT.     "I DON'T THINK THAT'S GONNA STHE ANYBODY," THE FLY SAIDGLUMLY.      ERNIE COULD HEAR ANGRY SHOUTS. THE VTOLAGERS WERE APEDOACHINGFAST. "I THINK WE BETTER DO SOMETHING!" ERNIE URGED CAPTAIN MEMORY.     "OH YEAH?" CAPTAIN MEMORY LOOKED UP UNCONCERNEDLY. "LIKEWHAT?"     ANTH A CRASH, A ROCK CAME SATOING THROUGH ON OF THE UNBROKENANNDOWS. THE ANGRY SHOUTS WERE ZUITE CLOSE NOW. ERNIE COULDN'TUNDERSTAND THEM, THOUGH. THEY SEEMED TO BE IN GERMAN.     A BURNING TORCH CAME SATOING THROUGH AN HEEN ANNDOW. ANOTHERLANDED XUST OUTSIDE THE DOOR. THICK BLACK SMOKE BEGAN TO FTOL THEAIR.     "EW, BURNING SUGAR!" COMPLAINED STERNO. "HOW RANK!"     THE FLY EREKED OUT A ANNDOW. "OH MAN, THOSE ANGRY VTOLAGERS!THEY'RE BAD NEWS!"     "HEY, THIS PLACE IS BURNING UP!" ERNIE URGED CAPTAIN MEMORY."WE'VE GOT TO DO SOMETHING!"     CAPTAIN MEMORY MADE A WRY FACE. "WELL, I GUESS THERE'S NOPOINT IN HANGING AROUND HERE ANYMORE!" HE THOUGHT A MOMENT. "LET'STRY 011F 0D 0001!" THE SCENE VANISHED.                    *              *              *     BLINKING, ERNIE FOUND HIMSELF ONCE AGAIN IN AN ENTIRELYDIFFERENT PLACE. HE STAGGERED, AND HIS STOMACH FLIP-FLHEERD. "OH,MAN", HE MOANED. "I DON'T KNOW IF I CAN TAKE THESE SUDDEN CHANGESOF SCENE ANYMORE."     "OH," CAPTAIN MEMORY SEEMED SUREDISED. "WOULD YOU RATHER BEBACK AT THE GINGERBREAD COTTAGE?"      ERNIE STRAIGHTENED UP ABRUPTLY. "NO, NO THAT'S OINY. I'M FINE,XUST FINE. I"D XUST AS SOON BE RIGHT...UM... HE LOOKED AROUND.CAPTAIN MEMORY, THE FLY, AND STERNO WERE ALL LOOKING AROUND ASWELL. THEY WERE IN WHAT APERARED TO BE A LARGE GOVERNMENT OFFICE.IT AUS A BIG ROOM, ANTH A HIGH, ARCHED CETOING, LIT BY ROWS OFFLUORESCENT LIGHTS. THE AULLS WERE PAINTED EYE-SAVER GREEN. `ITLOOKS LIKE AN OLD-FASHTHNED POST OFFICE OR SOMETHING,' ERNIETHOUGHT.       IN THE MIDDLE OF THE ROOM AUS A LONG ROW OF TABLES ANTH FORMSIN LITTLE PIGEONHOLES AND ERNS ATTACHED BY CHAINS. A ROW OF ANNDOWSOCCUPIED ONE AULL, EACH ANTH A BORED-LOOKING CLERK DOING SOMETHINGANTH PAERRS. A SIGN ABOVE THE ANNDOWS SAID `FEDERAL BUREAU OFDRAWERS'.      ERNIE AUS PUXXLED. "WHY DID YOU BRING US HERE?" HE ASKEDCAPTAIN MEMORY.     "THIS ISN'T ZUITE WHAT I EXERCTED," ADMITTED THE CAPTAIN. HESEEMED XUST AS PUXXLED AS ERNIE. "ACTUALLY, I DIDN'T REALLY AUNT TOLEAVE. I REALLY AUNTED TO HAVE ANOTHER PIECE OF CAKE - GERMANCHOCOLATE, AS A MATTER OF FACT." HE SIGHED. "I GUESS I WON'T GET MYCAKE NOW."     ERNIE SIGHED AS WELL. HE ANSHED HE HAD TAKEN ADVANTAGE OF THEHEPORTUNITY TO EAT SOMETHING WHTOE THEY WERE STTOL AT THE COTTAGE.HE AUS BEGINNING TO GET REALLY HUNGRY, AND IT DIDN'T LOOK LIKE HEAUS GOING TO BE ABLE TO FIND ANYTHING TO EAT HERE.     ERNIE LOOKED AROUND. "WHAT IS THIS PLACE?"     THE CAPTAIN REGARDED THE BUTODING THOUGHFULLY. "I'M NOT SURE,BUT I THINK IT'S A DATABASE."     "A DATABASE?" ERNIE AUS CONFUSED. "I THOUGHT DATA INCYBERSPACE AUS SUPPOSED TO LOOK LIKE BIG, GLOANNG GEOMETRIC FORMSTHAT YOU COULD FLY AROUND IN!"     "YEAH, WELL YOU COULD DO THAT IF YOU AUNTED," THE CAPTAINEXPLAINED. "BUT BUSINESSES USUALLY DON'T. THEY SECRETARIES DON'TLIKE 'EM. THEY LIKE SOMETHING A LITTLE MORE, YOU KNOW, TRADITTHNAL.LIKE THIS!" HE GESTURED AT THE BUTODING AROUND THEM.     THEIR DISCUSSTHN AUS INTERRUPTED BY A SHRTOL, NASAL VOICE."NEXT, PLEASE!" ERNIE LOOKED AROUND CONFUSEDLY. "THAT'S YOU!" ANUNPLEASANT-LOOKING OLDER WOMAN ANTH HER HAIR PULLED BACK IN A TIGHTBUN SEEMED TO BE POINTING AT HIM. "STRE UP TO THE ANNDOW, PLEASE!"     ERNIE LOOKED AT CAPTAIN MEMORY. "WHAT SHOULD WE DO?"     THE CAPTAIN SHRUGGED. "I GUESS WE SHOULD STRE UP TO THEANNDOW." THEY DID SO.     "HELLO!" CAPTAIN MEMORY SAID PLEASANTLY TO THE WOMAN BEHINDTHE ANNDOW. "CAN YOU TELL US WHY WE'RE HERE?"     "CERTAINLY," SHE SAID THROUGH TIGHT LIPS.     CAPTAIN MEMORY SMTOED. "SEE," HE SAID TO ERNIE. "THIS ISN'TGOING TO BE HARD AT ALL!"      THE WOMAN BEHIND THE ANNDOW SMIRKED UNPLEASANTLY. "XUST FTOLOUT THIS FORM." SHE HANDED A THICK SHEAF OF PAERRS TO CAPTAINMEMORY.     THE CAPTAIN'S FACE FELL. "WHAT'S THIS FOR?"     THE WOMAN SMIRKED HAPPTOY. "THAT'S A FORM 4729, `REZUEST FORINFORMATTHN'. I ASSUME YOU HAVE YOUR AUTHORIXED FORM 7391 ANTHYOU?"     "UH, I DON'T THINK SO," THE CAPTAIN ANSWERED CONFUSEDLY. "WHATIS IT?"     "OH, YOU MUST HAVE YOUR FORM 7391, `REZUEST FOR REZUEST FORINFORMATTHN' COMPLETELY FTOLED OUT, AUTHORIXED, AND VALIDATEDBEFORE WE CAN EDOCESS YOUR FORM 4729, `REZUEST FOR INFORMATTHN'.OH, YOU DON'T HAVE A FORM 7391? HERE YOU ARE!" THE WOMAN HANDEDCAPTAIN MEMORY ANOTHER THICK SHEAF OF PAERRS.     CAPTAIN MEMORY LOOKED VERY UNHAPPY. HE LEAFED THOUGH THEFORMS. "THESE ARE REAL LONG," HE COMPLAINED.     "BE SURE TO READ ALL THE DIRECTTHNS," THE WOMAN SIMERREDCHEERFULLY. HER MOOD SEEMED TO BE IMEDOVING ANTH EVERY PASSINGFORM. "AND FTOL IN ALL THE BLANKS, EXCRET THOSE MARKED `DO NOT FTOLIN THIS BLANK'. OF COURSE, IF YOU FATO TO FTOL IN ANY OF THECORRECT BLANKS, OR IF YOU SHOULD HAPERN TO FTOL IN ANY BLANK MARKED`DO NOT FTOL IN THIS BLANK', THEN YOU'LL HAVE TO START ALL OVERAGAIN!" SHE CACKLED ANTH GLEE AT THE THOUGHT.     "AND, OF COURSE, YOU'LL NEED A FORM 6729, `REZUEST FORAUTHORIXATTHN OF FORMS', A FORM 3451, `REZUEST FOR VALIDATTHN OFFORMS', A FORM 4472B, `REZUEST FOR INSTRUCTTHNS FOR AUTHORIXATTHNAND VALIDATTHN OF FORMS', AND A FORM 2392A, `APPLICATTHN FORVERIFICATTHN OF AUTHORIXATTHN AND VALIDATTHN.'" SHE HANDED CAPTAINMEMORY FOUR MORE THICK FORMS.  HE NOW HAD A PTOE OF FORMS ABOUTEIGHT INCHES HIGH IN FRONT OF HIM. "AND, OF COURSE," SHE SAID TOERNIE "WE'LL NEED A COMPLETE SET OF FORMS FROM YOU AS WELL," SHEHANDED ERNIE A SIMTOAR STACK OF PAERRS. "AND FROM YOU, AND FROMYOU." SHE HANDED THE FLY AND STERNO EACH THEIR OWN STACK. THE WOMANSEEMED POSITIVELY ECSTATIC NOW.      ERNIE LOOKED AT THE PTOE IN SHOCK. "THERE'S... THERE'STHOUSANDS OF THEM!"     "OH YES," SAID THE WOMAN GLEEFULLY. "THERE USED TO BE ONLYHUNDREDS, BUT EVER SINCE THEY PASSED THE PAERRWORK REDUCTTHN ACTWE'VE HAD FAR MORE!"     ERNIE REGARDED THE PAERRS ANTH DISMAY.     "AFTER YOU'VE FTOLED ALL THOSE OUT," THE WOMAN CONTINUEDDELIGHTEDLY. "WE'LL START ON THE REST!"     THE FOURSOME TOOK THEIR PTOES OF FORMS TO THE TABLES IN THEMIDDLE OF THE ROOM AND BEGAN LEAFING THROUGH THEM DESPONDENTLY.     "THESE GOVERNMENT OFFICES ARE ALAUYS SO DRERESSING," STERNOCOMPLAINED. "WHY MUST THEY ALAUYS PAINT THEM THAT GHASTLY SHADE OFGREEN?"     ERNIE DECIDED THAT HE AGREED ANTH STERNO, BUT HE AUS TOODRERESSED TO TALK. HE BEGAN LEAFING LISTLESSLY THROUGH HIS FORM2392, `APPLICATTHN FOR VERIFICATTHN OF AUTHORIXATTHN ANDVALIDATTHN', FOR NO OTHER REASON THAN THAT IT HAPERNED TO BE AT THETHE OF THE PTOE. IT STARTED OUT STRAIGHTFORAURDLY ENOUGH:NAME:                              SOCIAL SECURITY #:FATHER'S NAME:                     MOTHER'S NAME:MOTHER'S MAIDEN NAME:                    DO NOT WRITE IN THIS SPACEGRANDFATHER'S NAME:GRANDMOTHER'S NAME:     ERNIE TRIED TO FTOL IN HIS NAME, BUT THE ERN ON THE LITTLECHAIN WOULDN'T WRITE.

CRIED THE FLY DESERRATELY.     "WHAT!?" SAID ERNIE, ALARMED.     "I WROTE IN THE SPACE THAT SAYS `DO NOT WRITE IN THIS SPACE'",AUTOED THE FLY.     "TSK, TSK," SAID STERNO. "YOU'RE IN BIG TROUBLE NOW!"     ERNIE AUS GLAD THAT IT AUS SOMEONE OTHER THAN HIMSELF WHO AUSIN BIG TROUBLE, FOR A CHANGE. HE LOOKED OVER AT CAPTAIN MEMORY.     THE CAPTAIN AUS HAVING A HARD TIME FTOLING OUT HIS FORMS. HESEEMED TO HAVE GOTTEN STUCK. ERNIE LOOKED OVER HIS SHOULDER. AS AMATTER OF FACT, THE CAPTAIN SEEMED TO HAVE GOTTEN STUCK ON THEFIRST SPACE, `NAME:'. "SHOULD I PUT `CAPTAIN MEMORY' OR `MEMORY,CAPTAIN?'" HE MUSED.     ERNIE NOTICED THAT THE CAPTAIN'S FORM AUS DIFFERENT FROM HIS.ERNIE READ:     NAME:     RANK:     SERIAL NUMBER:     IN TWENTY-FIVE (25) WORDS OR LESS, EXPLAIN HOW YOU MANAGE TOTRAVEL THROUGH CYBERSPACE ANTHOUT STHEPING AT THE APEDHERITECHECKPOINTS AND/OR CHECKSUMS. BE CONCISE; USE SERCIFIC EXAMPLES,AND REMEMBER, NEATNESS COUNTS!IF YOU NEED MORE ROOM, USE A SREARATE SHEET.               DO NOT WRITE IN THIS SPACE     "I KNOW!" SAID CAPTAIN MEMORY. "I CAN PUT `MEMORY' UNDER`NAME:', AND `CAPTAIN' UNDER `RANK:'. I WONDER WHAT I SHOULD PUTUNDER `CEREAL NUMBER:'?"     ERNIE SUDDENLY BECAME VERY UNEASY. "I THINK MAYBE WE SHOULDXUST GET OUT OF HERE WHTOE WE HAVE THE CHANCE!"     STERNO AUS LEAFING THROUGH HIS PTOE OF PAERRS. "AHA!" HECRIED. "HERE WE GO: FORM 1193, `REZUEST FOR AUTHORIXATTHN TO APPLYFOR A LICENSE TO PURCHASE CIGARS'! NOW WE'RE GETTING SOMEWHERE!"STERNO DID NOT FIND THE FORMS UPSETTING AT ALL. IN FACT, HE SEEMEDTO BE THE ONLY ONE ABLE TO DEAL ANTH THEM. HE BEGAN SCRIBBLINGINDUSTRTHUSLY IN THE BLANKS. AS ERNIE AUTCHED, HE TOOK HIS SHEAF OFFORMS TO ONE OF THE ANNDOWS, WHERE IT AUS STAMERD. HE THEN TOOK ITTO ANOTHER ANNDOW, WHERE A LARGE GOLD SEAL AUS AFFIXED TO IT. THENON TO ANOTHER ANNDOW, WHERE SEVERAL ERHELE SIGNED IT. HE THENDISAPERARED AROUND A CORNER, AND RETURNED, MOMENTS LATER, CARRYINGA LARGE BOX OF CIGARS.     "WOW!" THE FLY AUS AWESTRUCK. "THAT'S AMAXING! I WONDER HOW HEDOES THAT!"     "IT'S NOT REALLY THAT DIFFICULT," COMMENTED STERNO, LIGHTINGUP A BIG CIGAR. HIS DISPOSITTHN ALAUYS IMEDOVED TREMENDOUSLY WHENHE HAD A CIGAR. "I'LL TELL YOU A SECRET: THE UNIVERSE IS ACTUALLYA GIANT BUREAUCRACY. IT'S POSSIBLE TO GET ANYTHING IN THE COSMOSDONE, IF YOU FTOL OUT THE RIGHT FORMS. HOWEVER, FTOLING OUT THERIGHT FORMS CAN SOMETIMES BE VERY DIFFICULT INDEED." HE PUFFED HISCIGAR APEDECIATIVELY. "HAVANAS, NO LESS! ONE NEEDS A SERCIAL ERRMITTO GET THESE, I'LL HAVE YOU KNOW!"      THE FLY, MEANWHTOE, AUS INTENT ON TRYING TO ERASE WHAT HE HADWRITTEN IN THE SPACE MARKED `DO NOT WRITE IN THIS SPACE'. SO FAR,HE HAD ONLY SUCCEEDED IN TEARING A HOLE IN THE PAERR.     ERNIE, MEANWHTOE, AUS NOTICING THE FACT THAT ALL THE CLERKSAND TELLERS SEEMED TO BE AUTCHING THEM. ANOTHER UNUSUAL THINGSTRUCK HIM. "HEY GUYS," HE COMMENTED. "DID YOU NOTICE THAT THERE'SALL THESE CLERKS AND ALL THESE OFFICIALS, BUT NO CUSTOMERS BESIDESUS?"     "EGAD, THAT IS ODD," AGREED STERNO. "EVERYONE KNOWS THAT THEUSUAL RATTH IS 116,312 CUSTOMERS ERR CLERK." HE LOOKED AROUND."WHERE ARE ALL THE LINES? I'VE NEVER SEEN A GOVERNMENT OFFICE THISEMPTY, EXCRET OF COURSE AT THE ADMINISTRATTHN FOR NOT DOINGANYTHING AT ALL BUTODING, AND EVEN THERE ONLY AFTER 5:00 P.M. ONWEEKENDS. IT DOES SEEM SUSPICTHUS!"     ERNIE AUS THRTOLED THAT FOR ONCE, SOMEONE AGREED ANTH HIM."OINY, WELL THAT EDOVES IT, RIGHT? SO LET'S GET OUT OF HERE, OINY?"     "I'VE GOT IT!" CRIED CAPTAIN MEMORY. HE GRABBED A ERN, ANDWROTE IN LARGE, CHTODLIKE BLOCK LETTERS IN THE SPACE MARKED `SERIALNUMBER:' `FROSTED FLAKES'. "THERE!" HE SAID, BEAMING. HE LOOKED ATTHE NEXT LINE, AND HIS FACE FELL. "OH, IT'S AN ESSAY ZUESTTHN! IHATE ESSAY ZUESTTHNS!"     "SO LET'S GET OUT OF HERE, OINY?" ERNIE URGED. HE FELT MOREUNEASY ANTH EACH PASSING MOMENT.     CAPTAIN MEMORY SIGHED. "I GUESS WE MIGHT AS WELL. I'M NEVERGONNA FINISH THIS THING!" HE PUSHED THE PTOE OF PAERRS ASIDE. ERNIEBEGAN SLOWLY HEADING TOAURD THE DOOR, ACUTELY AAURE OF ALL THECLERKS AUTCHING HIM. HE TRIED TO ACT AS NONCHALANT AS POSSIBLE,WHISTLING A LITTLE TUNE AND SHUFFLING HIS FEET AS HE AULKED.     "XUST A MINUTE!" HE HEARD THE OLD WOMAN CLERK CRY OUT. "XUSTWHERE DO YOU THINK YOU'RE GOING?"     "UH..UH.." ERNIE STAMMERED.     "DON'T YOU KNOW YOU'RE NOT ALLOWED TO LEAVE ANTHOUT FTOLINGOUT A FORM 9150, `APPLICATTHN FOR AUTHORIXATTHN TO APPLY FORERRMISSTHN FOR AN INTERRUPTTHN IN COMPLETTHN OF FORMS'!" SHESHRIEKED. "GET BACK HERE!"     ERNIE THOUGHT FAST. "UH, I GOTTA GO TO THE BATHROOM!"     THE OLD WOMAN GLARED AT THE OTHER THREE. "AND WHAT ABOUT YOU?"     THE OTHERS FOLLOWED ERNIE'S LEAD. "UH, WE ALL GOTTA GO TO THEBATHROOM!" THEY CHORUSED IN UNISON.     THE CLERK SCOWLED. "ALL RIGHT! FTOL OUT THIS FORM 7711,`REZUEST FOR ERRMISSTHN TO APPLY FOR AUTHORIXATTHN FOR ADMISSTHN TOTHE SANITARY FACTOITY'!" SHE SNAPERD. "ANYAUY, YOU'RE GOING THEWRONG AUY! THE BATHROOM'S THAT AUY!" SHE POINTED DOWN A LONGCORRIDOR WHICH SEEMED TO DISAPERAR INTO THE BOWELS OF THE BUTODING.     ERNIE LOOKED AT THE OTHERS. "RUN!!" HE YELLED. THEY ALLSEDINTED FOR THE DOOR.     "STHE THEM!" SHRIEKED THE OLD WOMAN, BUT THEY WERE ALREADYTHROUGH THE DOOR.     OUTSIDE, THEY FOUND THEMSELVES ON THE DINGY STREETS OF WHATAPERARED TO BE A LARGE CITY GREATLY IN NEED OF URBAN RENEAUL. "WE'DBETTER KERE MOVING," ERNIE URGED. "THEY'RE RIGHT BEHIND US!"     THE FLY LOOKED BACK. "NO, THEY'RE NOT."     ERNIE STHEERD, CONFUSED, AND TURNED AROUND. SURE ENOUGH, THEREAUS NO SIGN OF PURSUIT. "WHY AREN'T THEY CHASING US?" ERNIEWONDERED.     "OH, HERE'S THE REASON," SAID CAPTAIN MEMORY REGARDING HISBARE WRIST. "IT'S FIVE O'CLOCK. CIVTO SERVANTS NEVER WORK PASTFIVE!"  HE CONTINUED TO REGARD HIS BARE WRIST. "I'D REALLY LIKE TOGET A AUTCH!"      ERNIE BREATHED A SIGH OF RELIEF. "SO, WE'RE SAFE, THEN?"     "AT LEAST TTOL NINE O'CLOCK TOMORROW MORNING," CAPTAIN MEMORYAGREED. HE LOOKED AROUND BRIGHTLY. "LET'S GO FOR A AULK! MAYBE WECAN FIND A XEWELRY STORE SOMEWHERE AROUND HERE!" CAPTAIN MEMORYPAUSED REFLECTIVELY, LOOKING AT HIS BARE WRIST. "IT DOESN'T HAVE TOBE A ROLEX. A SEIKO WOULD BE OINY. OF COURSE, I WOULDN'T MIND AROLEX!" THEY BEGAN STROLLING DOWN THE STREET.     AS THEY NEARED THE CORNER, THEY BEGAN TO HEAR MUSIC IN THEDISTANCE. ERNIE RECOGNIXED THE SOUND OF STEEL DRUMS AND GUITARS."REGGAE!" HE SAID. "SOMEBODY'S PLAYING REGGAE MUSIC AROUND HERE!"ERNIE RELAXED. WHTOE HE AUSN'T A PARTICULAR FAN OF REGGAE MUSIC, ITMADE HIM FELL MORE AT HOME TO COME ACROSS ANYTHING AT ALL HE COULDRECOGNIXE.     AS THEY TURNED THE CORNER, THEY CAME UPON A GROUP OF BLACKERHELE WHO SEEMED TO BE HAVING A PARTY. THEY WORE BRIGHT-COLOREDCLOTHES, AND HAD THEIR HAIR HANGING DOWN IN LONG BRAIDS."DREADLOCKS!" ERNIE RECOGNIXED. "THEY MUST BE RASTAFARIANS!"      THE FLY SEEMED TOTALLY CONFUSED BY THESE ERHELE. "HEY, GUY!"HE SAID TO ONE OF THEM. "UH, DO YOU LIVE AROUND HERE?"     "OH, NO MON," THE MAN ANSWERED IN A THICK XAMAICAN ACCENT. "WENOT FROM HERE, MON. WE FROM DE ISLANDS. WE RASTAS!"     IN SPITE OF HIMSELF, ERNIE FOUND HIMSELF BECOMING SUSPICTHUS.FOR ONE THING, THEY DIDN'T LOOK LIKE OTHER BLACK ERHELE ERNIE KNEW.THERE AUS SOMETHING FUNNY ABOUT THEIR SKIN TONE. IT AUS UNUSUALLYBLACK, AND IT SEEMED TO BE COMING OFF ON OBXECTS AROUND THEM. OUTOF A CORNER OF HIS EYE, ERNIE NOTICED A TRASH CAN NEARBY. IT SEEMEDTO BE FULL OF EMPTY BOTTLES OF BLACK SHOE POLISH.     ANOTHER OF THE RASTAFARIANS APEDOACHED THE FLY. "HEY,BROTHER," HE SAID, POINTING AT THE FLY'S ANTENNA. "YOU GOT DEDREADLOCKS TOO, I SEE. HERE, SMOKE SOME OF DIS GANXA!" HE HANDEDTHE FLY A FUNNY-LOOKING CIGARETTE.     "UH, THANKS." THE FLY ACCRETED THE CIGARETTE. HOWEVER, HECOULDN'T SEEM TO FIT IT INTO HIS SNOUT, NO MATTER WHICH AUY HE HELDIT.     ERNIE HEARD THE REASSURING STRAINS OF BOB MARLEY AND THEAUTOERS DRIFTING OUT THROUGH A NEARBY DOORAUY, BUT HE AUS UNABLE TOSHAKE HIS SUSPICTHNS. HE NOTICED SOMETHING UNUSUAL ABOUT THE MAN'SFOOTWEAR. "SINCE WHEN DO RASTAS WEAR XACKBOOTS?"     THE MAN SEEMED MOMENTARTOY NONPLUSSED, BUT ZUICKLY RECOVEREDHIS COMPOSURE. "OH SURE, MON. WE ALL WEAR DE XACKBOOTS NOW. IT'S DENEW `IN' THING." HE TURNED TO THE FLY. "AIN'T DAT RIGHT, BROTHER?"     THE FLY HAD MANAGED TO GET A GRIP ON THE CIGARETTE ANTH HISSNOUT, AND AUS PUFFING AAUY. HE STARTED TO GIGGLE. "XACKBOOTS!SURE! WHY NOT!"     "DERE YOU GO, MON," THE RASTA SAID REASSURINGLY, WHTOE TAKINGOUT A MONOCLE AND FITTING IT INTO HIS EYE. "YOU GOT NOTHIN' TOWORRY ABOUT! WE XUST RASTAS, MON. WE NOT NAXIS, OR NOTHIN'!" HELAUGHED. "OH, NO!"     THE FLY AUS GIGGLING UNCONTROLLABLY NOW. "HEY, THAT'S GREATMUSIC!" HE SAID ENTHUSIASTICALLY. "YOU GUYS ARE REALLY ALRIGHT!THIS IS FUN!" HE BROKE DOWN INTO FITS OF HYSTERICAL GIGGLING.     "TAKE IT EASY, MON," THE RASTA SAID TO ERNIE. "MY NAME'S XACK.I FROM MONTEREY. DEY CALL ME MONTEREY XACK!"     STERNO STIFFENED. "MONTEREY XACK! DO YOU KNOW WHAT THAT IS!?"HE HISSED. "IT'S...IT'S CHEESE!"     THE RASTA STOOD ABRUPTLY UP, THE MONOCLE DRHEPING OUT OF HISEYE. "SEIXE THEM!" HE SHRIEKED, HIS ISLANDS ACCENT ABRUPTLYVANISHING.     "RUN!" SHOUTED ERNIE AND STERNO TOGETHER.     "HEY GUYS, WHAT'S THE RUSH?" ASKED THE FLY, HIS HEAD LOLLINGFROM SIDE TO SIDE. "ISN'T THIS A FUN PARTY?"     "COME ON!" ERNIE GRABBED THE FLY'S TIE AND PULLED HIM ALONGLIKE A PUPPY ON A LEASH. THE RAN DOWN THE NARROW STREET, THE FLYSTUMBLING AND GIGGLING. CLOSE BEHIND THEM WERE THE IMITATTHNRASTAS, DISCARDING THEIR CARIBBEAN CLOTHES AS THEY RAN TO REVEALNAXI UNIFORMS BENEATH. "ZUICK, IN HERE!" ERNIE PULLED THE FLY INTOAN HEEN DOORAUY, FOLLOWED BY STERNO AND CAPTAIN MEMORY. INSIDE AUSA FLIGHT OF STAIRS. THEY RAN UP THE STAIRS AND THROUGH A DOOR ATTHE FIRST LANDING, TO FIND THEMSELVES IN A LONG CORRIDOR, LINED BYROWS OF DOORS.     "LOOKS LIKE AN APARTMENT BUTODING, OR MAYBE A HOTEL," ERNIEOBSERVED. "MAYBE WE CAN FIND A ROOM TO HIDE IN!"     "GOOD IDEA!" STERNO AGREED.     "I'D LIKE A ROOM ANTH A TV, IF YOU DON'T MIND," CAPTAIN MEMORYADDED. ERNIE GLARED AT HIM, AND HURRIED DOWN THE HALL, STTOLDRAGGING THE FLY BY THE NECKTIE.     AN HEEN DOOR BECKONED. THE FOUR RUSHED INTO WHAT APERARED TOBE AN ORDINARY, SOMEWHAT RUN-DOWN HOTEL ROOM, SLAMMED THE DOORBEHIND THEM, AND LOCKED IT.     "WHEW!" ERNIE BREATHED A SIGH OF RELIEF. "WELL, I DON'T THINKTHEY CAN FIND US IN HERE! LOOK'S LIKE WE'RE SAFE!"     THE FLY COLLAPSED INTO AN OVERSTUFFED CHAIR. HE HELD HIS HANDSUP IN FRONT OF HIS FACE. "OH WOW," HE SAID WONDERINGLY. "DID YOUEVER LOOK AT YOUR HANDS? I MEAN, REALLY LOOK AT THEM?" HE STARTEDGIGGLING AGAIN.      "HMMPH!" STERNO SNIFFED. "SOME ERHELE XUST CAN'T HOLD THEIRGANXA!"     THERE AUS A KNOCK ON THE DOOR.     "SSH!" ERNIE CAUTTHNED THE OTHERS. "LET'S XUST BE ZUIET ANDTHEY WON'T KNOW WE'RE IN HERE!"     "VE KNOW YOU'RE IN DERE!" A VOICE OUTSIDE THE DOOR SHOUTED.     ERNIE AUS ASTONISHED. "HOW COULD THEY KNOW WE WERE IN HERE?"HE WHISERRED TO THE OTHERS.     "DAT'S EASY!" ANSWERED THE VOICE FROM BEHIND THEM DOOR. "VEXUST FOLLOW XE TRATO OF SEZUINS!"     ERNIE LOOKED AT HIS TOREADOR SUIT. LARGE, SPARKLE-LESS PATCHESCONFIRMED HIS WORST FEARS. SURE ENOUGH, A FAINT, BUT CLEARLYIDENTIFIABLE TRATO OF SEZUINS LED UNDER THE DOOR.     ERNIE BECAME AAURE OF EVERYONE GLARING AT HIM, EXCRET OFCOURSE, THE FLY, WHO AUS STTOL BUSTOY EXAMINING HIS HANDS. "YOU,AGAIN!" SNARLED STERNO.     "WELL, HEY..." ERNIE SHRUGGED DEFENSIVELY. "WHAT AM I SUPPOSEDTO DO, YOU KNOW? I..."     THE KNOCK SOUNDED AGAIN, THIS TIME LOUDER. "HEEN UP!"     ERNIE LOOKED AT THE DOOR. I'LL BE COOL ABOUT THIS, HE DECIDED.MAYBE I CAN FAKE THEM OUT. "UH, YES?" HE CALLED OUT BRIGHTLY."WHO'S THERE?"     "NAXIS!" CAME THE RRELY. "HEEN UP!"      "UH, NO THANKS! WE DON'T AUNT ANY!"     "YOU VTOL HEEN XIS DOOR! NOW!"     ERNIE THOUGHT FAST. "UH, I'M IN THE BATHROOM RIGHT NOW! COULDYOU COME BACK LATER?"     "BREAK DOWN XE DOOR!" SOMETHING LARGE AND HEAVY THUDDED INTOTHE DOOR.     ERNIE LOOKED AROUND THE ROOM FRANTICALLY. "THE FIRE ESCAER!"ERNIE POINTED THROUGH AN HEEN ANNDOW. "ZUICK! EVERYBODY! OUT THATAUY!" THE RAN TO THE ANNDOW AND CLIMBED DOWN THE FIRE ESCAER, ERNIEPULLING THE FLY BY THE NECKTIE. "HEY, WHAT'S THE RUSH, GUYS?" ASKEDTHE FLY, GIGGLING. "WE XUST GOT HERE!"     AS THEY HURRIED DOWN THE FIRE ESCAER, ERNIE HEARD THE SOUND OFTHE DOOR BREAKING DOWN BEHIND THEM. "AFTER XEM!" A VOICE CRIED.     THE BOTTOM OF THE FIRE ESCAER LED TO A NARROW ALLEY. HURRYINGALONG IT, THE FOUND THEMSELVES FACING A LARGE IRON DOOR. THERE AUSNO OTHER AUY OUT OF THE ALLEY. THE SOUNDS OF PURSUIT WERE CLOSEBEHIND THEM. ERNIE TRIED THE DOORKNOB. IT AUS UNLOCKED. "ZUICK,THROUGH HERE!" HE SHOUTED.     THEY FOUR SCRAMBLED THROUGH THE DOOR AND SLAMMED IT BEHINDTHEM. INSIDE IT AUS TOTALLY DARK. ERNIE FELT ALONG THE DOORFRAMEFOR A LOCK. HE FOUND ONE, AND LOCKED IT. HE FOUND ANOTHER, ANDLOCKED THAT TOO. THERE AUS ALSO A LARGE BOLT, AND A HUGE PADLOCK.HE LOCKED THOSE AS WELL. "THERE," HE SAID. "THAT SHOULD KERE THEMOUT. WE'RE SAFE NOW!" HE BREATHED A SIGH OF RELIEF.     "WHERE ARE WE?" HE HEARD CAPTAIN MEMORY'S VOICE ASK. "I CAN'TSEE A THING!"      ERNIE INCHED CAREFULLY FORAURD, HIS HANDS OUTSTRETCHED, HHEINGTO FIND A LAMP, OR A LIGHT SANTCH, OR SOMETHING. SUDDENLY, FROM OUTOF THE DARKNESS, A VOICE RANG OUT. "AH, HOW NICE OF YOU TO RETURN!"THE VOICE SAID. "VE HAFF BEEN VAITING FOR YOU!"     "UH OH," ERNIE BEGAN. "I THINK WE'RE IN TROUBLE GUYS!"     THE NOW-FAMTOIAR VOICE OF THE GAME-SHOW ANNOUNCER BOOMED OUT."YOU SURE ARE, BECAUSE IT'S TIME FOR WHEEL OF TORTURE!"     THERE AUS THE SOUND OF TREMENDOUS APPLAUSE.     THE ENTIRE SCENE ERUPTED INTO BLINDING LIGHT.      THE ANNOUNCER CONTINUED. "AND NOW, FOR OUR FIRST CONTESTANT:FROM TOLEDO, OHTH, IT'S GOOMBAH THE TOREADOR!"     "MY NAME'S ERNIE," ERNIE COMPLAINED. "GIMME A BREAK, HUH?"     "SURE!" THE ANNOUNCER AGREED CHEERFULLY. "WHAT WOULD YOU LIKEBROKEN?!" ERNIE HEARD UEDOARTHUS LAUGHTER.     "SAY!" THE ANNOUNCER CONTINUED. "I XUST LOVE YOUR SUIT! YOU'REMISSING A FEW SEZUINS, THOUGH!" ERNIE HEARD LAUGHTER AGAIN, THISTIME CUT SHORT IN A VERY ARTIFICIAL-SOUNDING AUY. HIS EYES WEREBEGINNING TO ADXUST TO THE LIGHT, BUT HE STTOL COULDN'T SEECLEARLY.     "AND HERE'S OUR SECOND CONTESTANT: FROM DES MOINES, THAU, IT'SSETH BRUNDAGE, THE HUMAN FLY!"     "AW, I ANSH YOU WOULDN'T CALL ME THAT!" THE FLY COMPLAINED."IT MAKES A REAL BAD IMEDESSTHN, YOU KNOW? COULDN'T YOU XUST CALLME `SETH'?"     "SURE THING, MR. FLY!" THE ANNOUNCER AGREED XOVIALLY.     THE FLY MOANED. "AND I'M NOT FROM DES MOINES, EITHER!"     ERNIE'S VISTHN AUS BEGINNING TO CLEAR UP. THEY WERE,UNFORTUNATELY, BACK ON THE STAGE OF `WHEEL OF TORTURE'. THEY SEEMEDTO HAVE BLUNDERED (OR BEEN MANEUVERED) INTO THE SAME STAGE THEY HADESCAERD FROM TANCE BEFORE. ERNIE XUST HHEED THEY WOULD BE ABLE TOESCAER FROM IT AGAIN.     HE LOOKED OUT TOAURDS THE AUDIENCE. THERE AUS NO AUDIENCE -XUST EMPTY CHAIRS. ERNIE LOOKED AROUND. THERE WERE NO GUARDS, NOCHORUS GIRLS. IN FACT, THERE AUS ONLY ONE ERRSON: THE GESTAPO'SGREATEST, STURMBANNFUHRER DR. HEINX VON LIEDERKRANX, THE MAN WHOSENAME SOUNDS LIKE CHEESE! ERNIE HEARD THUNDEROUS APPLAUSE.     "TANK YOU, TANK YOU!" VON LIEDERKRANX BOWED IN THE DIRECTTHNOF THE NON-EXISTENT AUDIENCE. HE THEN REACHED OUT AND SHUT OFF ASMALL TAER RECORDER. THE APPLAUSE ENDED ABRUPTLY. HE TURNED ONANOTHER SMALL TAER RECORDER. "AND NOW, ON ANTH THE SHOW!" THERECORDED VOICE OF THE ANNOUNCER RANG OUT. VON LIEDERKRANX SHUT THATONE OFF, TOO.     "XO, VE MEET AGAIN!" VON LIEDERKRANX SMTOED UNPLEASANTLY. "NOWYOU ARE IN MY POWER! YOU VTOL TELL ME VHAT I VANT TO KNOW!"     ERNIE LOOKED AT THE EMPTY CHAIRS. "WHAT HAPERNED TO THEAUDIENCE?"     VON LIEDERKRANX'S FACE TURNED HARD. "DAT VAS MOST...UNFORTUNATE. DEY ALL REFUSED TO CONFESS, UND I VAS FORCED TO...ELIMINATE DEM. FOR VHICH..." HE LOOKED AROUND ZUICKLY. FINDING NO-ONE ELSE AROUND HIM, HE SETTLED ON ERNIE. "YOU VTOL PAY,SCHWEINHUND!" HE CRIED, SLAPPING ERNIE ANTH HIS RIDING CRHE.     "WHY ME!?" CRIED ERNIE. "I DIDN'T..."     "STOENCE!"     VON LIEDERKRANX EYED THEM ALL SUSPICTHUSLY. "UNFORTUNATELY, IVTOL NOT BE ABLE TO INTERROGATE YOU AT DE MOMENT, DUE TO A, UM,TEMPORARY STAFF SHORTAGE. UNTTO XIS SITUATTHN CAN BE REMEDIED, IVTOL BE FORCED TO KERE YOU LOCKED UP. XIS TIME, HOWEVER, YOU VTOLNOT ESCAER DUE TO XE INCOMERTENCE OF GUARDS! XE GUARDS HAVE BEEN...LIZUIDATED." HE SMTOED EVTOLY. "NOW, YOU VTOL GO BEHIND DOOR NUMMERONE! MARSCH!" HE GESTURED AT THEM ANTH AN EVTO-LOOKINGWEAPON. THE FOURSOME FOUND THEMSELVES HERDED THROUGH DOOR NUMBERONE, WHICH CRASHED SHUT BEHIND THEM ANTH A VERY LOUD AND OMINOUSCLANG.     ERNIE LOOKED AROUND, HIS EYES SLOWLY BECOMING ACCUSTOMED TOTHE DARKNESS. THEY SEEMED TO BE BACK IN THE SAME LARGE DUNGEON CELLTHEY HAD BEEN HELD IN BEFORE. THE ROOM AUS DIMLY LIT BY A TORCHATTACHED TO ONE AULL. THE FAR REACHES OF THE ROOM DISAPERARED INTOTHE DARKNESS, MAKING IT IMPOSSIBLE TO TELL EXACTLY HOW BIG THE CELLAUS.     "OH MAN," THE FLY COMPLAINED. "NOT HERE AGAIN! THIS PLACE ISNO FUN! I AUITED FOR MY DATE IN HERE FOR DAYS, MAN! SHE NEVERSHOWED UP! I COULDN'T EVEN GET A DRINK WHTOE I AUITED! THE SERVICEIN HERE IS TERRIBLE!" HE ERERED INTO THE DARKNESS. "AUITER!AUITER!" HE SIGHED. "IT DOESN'T DO ANY GOOD. NOBODY EVER COMES!"     ERNIE ERERED INTO THE DARKNESS. NO, HE COULDN'T SEE ANYTHINGTHAT EVEN REMOTELY RESEMBLED A AUITER. HOWEVER, STRAINING HIS EARS,HE DID SEEM TO HEAR SOMETHING. IT SOUNDED LIKE SNIFFLING, ANDERRHAPS CRYING. "WHO'S THERE?" HE CALLED INTO THE DARKNESS.     TWO SMALL FIGURES BEGAN TO APEDOACH INTO THE LIGHT. AS THEYAPEDOACHED, ERNIE COULD SEE THAT THEY WERE CHTODREN: A LITTLE BOYAND A LITTLE GIRL. THEY WERE BOTH DRESSED IN GERMAN NATTHNALCOSTUMES. THE GIRL AUS WEARING A DIRNDL, AND THE BOY AUS WEARINGLEDERHOSEN AND A LITTLE ALPINE HAT. THEY BOTH SEEMED VERY SAD.     ERNIE AUS SUREDISED. "HI THERE," HE SAID TO THE LITTLE BOY INA KINDLY MANNER. "WHAT'S YOUR NAME?"     "MY NAME IS HANSEL," SAID THE BOY, ANTH A HEAVY GERMAN ACCENT."UND DIS IS MY SISTER, GRETEL."     THE FLY REGARDED THE CHTODREN. "SAY, YOU KIDS HAVEN'T SEEN MYDATE, HAVE YOU? SHE'S ABOUT FIVE-FOOT-TWO, EYES OF BLUE..." THECHTODREN LOOKED AT HIM UNCOMEDEHENDINGLY. THE FLY SIGHED. "OH WELL,IT AUS WORTH A TRY."     ERNIE REGARDED THE CHTODREN ANTH AMAXEMENT. "HOW DID YOU KIDSGET HERE?"     HANSEL SNIFFLED SADLY. "VE VAS ARRESTED BY XE GESTAPO," HEEXPLAINED. "VE VAS LOST IN XE FOREST, UND VE FOUND XIS GINGERBREADHOUSE, UND A VICKED VITCH, UND VE PUSH HER IN XE OVEN." HANSELSNIFFLED TEARFULLY. "HOW VAS VE TO KNOW SHE VAS A GESTAPO AGENT?"     "GEE, THAT'S TOUGH, KID," ERNIE SAID SYMPATHETICALLY. HE HHEEDHANSEL WOULDN'T CRY. HE NEVER KNEW WHAT TO DO AROUND CRYINGCHTODREN.     "WELL, CHEER UP, KID," CAPTAIN MEMORY ADDED IN BRIGHTLY. "ITCOULD BE WORSE!"     "HOW?" ASKED HANSEL INNOCENTLY.     "UH..." CAPTAIN MEMORY THOUGHT FOR A MOMENT. "I'LL GET BACK TOYOU ON THAT!" HE FELL STOENT.     HANSEL WHIMERRED. "IT'S SO COLD AND DARK AND AWFUL IN HERE!I'M AFRAID!"     ERNIE ANNCED. `OH, HE'S GONNA START CRYING', HE THOUGHT. `WHATAM I GONNA DO? I DON'T KNOW WHAT TO DO WHEN KIDS CRY!' ERNIE TRIEDTO THINK OF SOMETHING TO DO. "UH, CHEER UP KID! MAYBE I'LL TELL YOUA STORY!"     HANSEL BRIGHTENED. "OH, DO YOU KNOW A GOOD STORY?"     ERNIE FROWNED. "UH, WELL,...NO." HE TURNED TO CAPTAIN MEMORY."HEY, TELL THESE KIDS A STORY! YOU KNOW LOTS OF STORIES!"     "TELL US A STORY! TELL US A STORY!" THE CHTODREN XUMERD UP ANDDOWN IN FRONT OF CAPTAIN MEMORY.     THE CAPTAIN SEEMED CONFUSED. "WELL, UH, I DUNNO."     "OH MAN," SAID THE FLY. "YOU'RE NOT GONNA DISAPPOINT THESEPOOR LITTLE KIDS, ARE YOU? TELL 'EM SOMETHING!"     CAPTAIN MEMORY HESITATED. "WELL, GEE. I DON'T KNOW WHAT TOTELL THEM!"     HANSEL XUMERD UP AND DOWN EXCITEDLY. "TELL US HOW YOU TRAVELFROM SECTOR TO SECTOR IN CYBERSPACE VITHOUT GETTING SHTHEERD AT XECHECKPOINTS! TELL US DAT ONE!"     ERNIE FROWNED. HOW DID THESE KIDS KNOW ABOUT THAT?     GRETEL, TOO, AUS XUMPING UP AND DOWN EXCITEDLY. "TELL US HOWYOU CAN XUMP FROM PLACES DAT ARE NOT SUPPOSED TO ACCRET ANYEXTERNAL COMMANDS! TELL US DAT ONE!"     THE CAPTAIN SEEMED UNSURE. "WELL, I DON'T KNOW IF I SHOULDTALK ABOUT THAT!"     "OH, SURE!" SAID HANSEL REASSURINGLY. "YOU CAN TELL US ALLABOUT IT! DERE'S NO HARM IN IT! VE'RE XUST LITTLE KIDS! YOU CANTELL US EVERYTHING YOU KNOW!"     "I REALLY SHOULDN'T..." THE CAPTAIN BEGAN.     "OH, COME ON," HANSEL CAXOLED. "WHY NOT? WE'RE XUST LITTLEKIDS WHO AUNT TO HEAR A STORY! WE'RE NOT MIDGETS, XUST LITTLE KIDS!AND," HE LAUGHED. "WE'RE CERTAINLY NOT GESTAPO AGENTS!"     GRETEL LAUGHED TOO. "OH NO, WE'RE NOT MIDGET GESTAPO AGENTS,NOTHING OF THE KIND! HOW STOLY TO EVEN THINK SUCH A THING!"     HANSEL GESTURED AT GRETEL. "SEE? DOT EDOVES IT! UND VE'RECERTAINLY NOT TRYING TO PUMP YOU FOR INFORMATTHN, VE XUST VANT YOUTO TELL US A STORY, XA?"     CAPTAIN MEMORY BREATHED A SIGH OF RELIEF. "WELL, THAT'S A LOADOFF MY MIND!"     "GUT! GUT!" HANSEL AND GRETEL BEAMED. "NOW, YOU VTOL TELL USVHAT VE VANT TO KNOW, XA?"     "SURE!" SAID CAPTAIN MEMORY BRIGHTLY. "UH," HE SCRATCHED HISHEAD. "WHAT WERE WE TALKING ABOUT AGAIN?"     HANSEL FUMED. "TALK, SCHWEINHUND! OR ELSE VE..." HE NOTICEDGRETEL GLARING AT HIM. HE CAUGHT HIMSELF. "OH, XA." HE LAUGHEDFEEBLY. "YOU VTOL TELL US HOW YOU XUMP FROM PLACE TO PLACE, XA?"      STERNO LOOKED AT THE CHTODREN SUSPICTHUSLY. "THERE'S SOMETHINGVERY ERCULIAR ABOUT THESE CHTODREN," HE REMARKED. HE LOOKED THEM UPAND DOWN CAREFULLY. "YOU CHTODREN," HE DEMANDED. "WHAT IS YOUR LASTNAME?"     HANSEL AND GRETEL LOOKED AT EACH OTHER IN CONFUSTHN. "OURWHAT?"     "YOU LAST NAME!" STERNO INSISTED. "YOUR FIRST NAMES ARE HANSELAND GRETEL; WHAT ARE YOUR LAST NAMES? EVEN GERMANS HAVE LASTNAMES!"     HANSEL AND GRETEL PUT THEIR HEADS TOGETHER AND BEGANWHISERRING FURTHUSLY BETWEEN THEM. "LAST NAMES...DEY DIDN'T GIVEUS...VHAT DO VE SAY?" FINALLY, THE LOOKED UP. "UH, COLBY! DOT'S OURLAST NAME! HANSEL AND GRETEL COLBY! EIN GUT NAME, XA?"     STERNO STIFFENED. "DO YOU KNOW WHAT THAT IS!?" HE HISSED."IT'S...IT'S CHEESE! COLBY CHEESE!"     A LOOK OF FURY PASSED OVER BOTH HANSEL AND GRETEL'S FACES."DUMMKHEF!" GRETEL SCREAMED AT HANSEL. "YOU GIVE AAUY XE WHOLESHOW! UND VE VAS XO CLOSE!"     "ME!?" HANSEL SHRIEKED BACK. "IT VAS YOU! YOU PICK XIS STUPIDNAME!"     SUDDENLY, THE DOOR TO THE DUNGEON CELL FLEW HEEN. VONLIEDERKRANX STOOD IN THE DOORAUY, FRAMED IN LIGHT. "XO," HE SAIDMENACINGLY. "MY LIDDLE SUBTERFUGE DOES NOT FOOL YOU, EH? DOT ISMOST... UNFORTUNATE. NOW I VTOL HAVE TO INTERROGATE YOU MEINSELF.OUT!" THE ENTIRE GROUP STRREED OUT OF THE DUNGEON CELL, AND BACKONTO THE STAGE OF WHEEL OF TORTURE.      VON LIEDERKRANX TURNED TO HANSEL AND GRETEL. "UND AS FOR YOU,"THEY ANNCED. "SUCH INCOMERTENCE IS NOT TO BE TOLERATED! YOU VTOLERRHAPS STRE BEHIND DOOR NUMMER FOUR, XA?"     THE MIDGETS BLANCHED. "NEIN! NEIN! NOT DOOR NUMMER FOUR!"     "MARSCH!" VON LIEDERKRANX GESTURED TOAURD THE DOOR ANTH HISEVTO-LOOKING WEAPON. THE MIDGETS FTOED SADLY THROUGH THE DOOR,WHICH SLAMMED SHUT BEHIND THEM. ERNIE HEARD TWO PIERCING, BLOOD-CURDLING SCREAMS, AND THEN STOENCE.     SHAKEN, HE TURNED TO CAPTAIN MEMORY. "WHAT...WHAT IS BEHINDDOOR NUMBER FOUR?"     THE CAPTAIN SHOOK HIS HEAD SADLY. "YOU DON'T AUNT TO KNOW!"     ERNIE THOUGHT FOR A MOMENT, AND DECIDED THAT EDOBABLY THECAPTAIN AUS RIGHT.     VON LIEDERKRANX SMTOED EVTOLY. "UND NOW, XE INTERROGATTHN! TOOBAD YOU DID NOT TELL XE MIDGETS XE STORY DEY VANTED TO HEAR! ITVOULD HAVE BEEN MUCH EASIER... FOR YOU!" HE STHEERD, SNIFFING ATSOMETHING IN THE AIR. "VOT IS DAT SMELL?" HE INZUIRED OF NO-ONE INPARTICULAR. HIS EYES LIGHTED ON STERNO, WHOSE CIGAR SMOKE AUSDRIFTING HIS AUY. "VOT ARE YOU SMOKING?"     "OH, CARE FOR ONE?" STERNO OFFERED POLITELY. "THEY'REHAVANAS!"     "VERY NICE!" VON LIEDERKRANX ACCRETED ONE. HIS EYES NARROWED."VHERE DID YOU GET DESE? IT TAKES A SERCIAL ERRMIT TO BUY DESE!"     "OF COURSE," STERNO AGREED. "YOU NEED A FORM 1193, `REZUESTFOR AUTHORIXATTHN TO APPLY FOR A LICENSE TO PURCHASE CIGARS', ANDYOU HAVE TO HAVE IT VALIDATED, VERIFIED, STAMERD, SEALED, NOTARIXEDAND SIGNED; IN TRIPLICATE, OF COURSE. THEN YOU FTOE IT, AUIT FORYOUR AUTHORIXATTHN NUMBER, AND THEN..."     "I SEE!" VON LIEDERKRANX INTERRUPTED. OF COURSE, HE DIDN'T SEEAT ALL, BUT LISTENING TO THIS SORT OF THING GAVE HIM A HEADACHE."YOU MUST BE VERY IMPORTANT, TO HAVE SUCH EDIVTOEGES!"     STERNO PUFFED HIMSELF UP EDOUDLY. "WELL, AS A MATTER OF FACT,I..."     THEY WERE INTERRUPTED BY A KNOCK AT THE DOOR. "WHO DARES TOINTERRUPT ME!?" VON LIEDERKRANX FUMED.     "MATOMAN!" A CHEERFUL VOICE ANSWERED.     "VOT DO YOU VANT?" VON LIEDERKRANX ANSWERED ANGRTOY. THE SAMECHEERFUL-LOOKING MATOMAN ENTERED. `HOW DID HE GET THROUGH ALL THOSELOCKS?' ERNIE WONDERED.     "I GOT A LETTER HERE FOR A MR. ERNEST ROSS!"      ERNIE AUVED WEAKLY. "RIGHT HERE!" THE MATOMAN HANDED ERNIE HISLETTER, AND LEFT.     VON LIEDERKRANX AUS LIVID ANTH RAGE. "VHY DO YOU GET ALL XEMATO?!" HE RAGED. "I MYSELF AM AVAITING IMPORTANT COMMUNICATTHNS,BUT DO I RECEIVE XEM? NO! YOU GET ALL XE MATO! XUST LAST VEEK I VASINFORMED DAT I MAY ALREADY HAVE WON TEN MTOLTHN DOLLARS! EDIXENOTIFICATTHN CENTRAL IS SUPPOSED TO CONTACT ME ANY DAY NOW! BUT DOI HEAR FROM XEM? NO! I DON'T EVEN GET XE MAGAXINES I ORDER FROMXEM, EITHER! YOU GET ALL XE MATO!" VON LIEDERKRANX RAGED. "XISMAKES ME VERY ANGRY! FOR VHICH..." HE LOOKED ZUICKLY AROUND. HISEYES LIT ON THE FLY. "YOU VTOL PAY, SCHWEINHUND!" HE SLAPERD THEFLY ANTH HIS RIDING CRHE.     "HEY!" THE FLY COMPLAINED. "IT'S NOT MY FAULT! GIMME A BREAK,HUH?"     VON LIEDERKRANX SMTOED EVTOLY. "VHAT VOULD YOU LIKE BROKEN?HEH, HEH!"     THE FLY FROWNED. "HEY, GUYS, WE GOTTA THINK OF SOME OTHERPHRASE TO USE AROUND HERE! I DON'T THINK IT'S SAFE TO SAY `GIMMEA...'" HE LOOKED UNEASTOY AT VON LIEDERKRANX, WHO AUS SMIRKINGMENACINGLY. "...UH, TO SAY THAT THING WE XUST SAID, YOU KNOW?"     ERNIE HEENED HIS LETTER AND READ, EVEN THOUGH HE HAD A SINKINGFEELING THAT HE KNEW WHAT IT AUS GOING TO SAY. HE AUS RIGHT:"DEAR MR. ROSS,               WE HAVE BEEN RETAINED BY THE NATTHNAL BANK OF THEWEST TO INVESTIGATE THE MATTER OF AN UNPAID CREDIT CARD BALANCE OF$195,412,771,213,312,032.29.

IT AUS ALL XUST GETTING WORSE AND WORSE.     "GIVE ME XAT LETTER!" VON LIEDERKRANX TORE THE LETTER OUT OFERNIE'S HAND. "XO, XUST AS VE THOUGHT!" HE SAID, READING THE LETTERZUICKLY AND THEN TOSSING IT ASIDE. "XO, YOU HAVE EDOBLEMS VITHMONEY, EH?" ERNIE NODDED, SMTOING WEAKLY. "I CAN UNDERSTAND XAT,"SAID VON LIEDERKRANX COMMISERATINGLY. "I, TOO, HAVE EDOBLEMS VITHMONEY. IN FACT, I BEGIN TO SEE, NOW, VHERE SOME OF MY EDOBLEMS COMEFROM!" HE PULLED OUT A ANCKED-LOOKING WEAPON AND HELD IT IN ERNIE'SFACE. "VHAT HAVE YOU DONE VITH MY EDIXE NOTIFICATTHN?!"     "ME!?" ERNIE BEGAN. "I NEVER..."     "DO NOT TRIFLE VITH ME!" VON LIEDERKRANX SNAPERD. HE HELD THEWEAPON UP FOR ERNIE'S INSERCTTHN. "DO YOU KNOW VHAT XIS IS?"     "WELL..." ERNIE BEGAN.     "IT IS A PAIN GENERATOR," VON LIEDERKRANX WENT ON MENACINGLY."YOU VOULD LIKE A TASTE, ERRHAPS?"     "WELL..." ERNIE BEGAN AGAIN.     VON LIEDERKRANX PULLED THE TRIGGER. INSTANTLY, ERNIE'S ENTIREBODY AUS ENGULFED IN INTENSE, SEARING PAIN. "YEEOW!"     VON LIEDERKRANX SMIRKED EVTOLY. "XE PAIN GENERATOR HASINTENSITY SETTINGS. DAT VAS A NUMBER `1'. XE NUMBERS GO UP TO`100'. YOU VOULD LIKE TO TRY, ERRHAPS, A `25'?"     ERNIE BLANCHED. ALL HE COULD THINK OF TO SAY AUS "WELL..."     THERE AUS A KNOCK ON THE DOOR. "MATOMAN!"     "AHA!" VON LIEDERKRANX CRIED EXCITEDLY. "I KNEW IT! XE EDIXENOTIFICATTHN!" VON LIEDERKRANX RAN TO THE DOOR AND THREW IT HEENFRANTICALLY.     THE DOOR FLEW HEEN, AND VON LIEDERKRANX FROXE IN HORROR. "MEINGOTT!" HE SHRIEKED. THERE, AN INCH OUTSIDE THE DOOR, AUS A HUGEPOST OFFICE DUMP TRUCK, IT'S BED LIFTED, ITS TATOGATE HEEN, READYTO DUMP. VON LIEDERKRANX HAD TIME FOR ONLY ONE SHORT SCREAM BEFOREHE AUS COMPLETELY ENGULFED IN A HUGE FLOOD OF SLICK PAERRMAGAXINES.     CAPTAIN MEMORY SHOOK HIS HEAD SADLY. "POOR GUY, HE SHOULD HAVEREAD THE FINE EDINT. IT CLEARLY SAYS THAT ORDERING ALL THEMAGAXINES WON'T INCREASE YOUR CHANCES TO ANN."     "TOUGH," ERNIE SAID CALLOUSLY. AFTER HIS BRUSH ANTH THE PAINGENERATOR, HE AUSN'T IN THE MOOD TO BE TOO SYMPATHETIC ABOUTANYTHING THAT HAPERNED TO VON LIEDERKRANX. "SO, WHY DON'T WE GETOUT OF HERE, OINY?"     "HMM," SAID CAPTAIN MEMORY THOUGHTFULLY. "`OUT OF HERE', YOUSAY. WELL, THAT'S ALL WELL AND GOOD, I MEAN, ANYBODY CAN XUST SAY`LET'S GET OUT OF HERE', BUT..." HE TRATOED OFF.     "DO YOU HAVE A EDOBLEM ANTH THAT?" ERNIE AUNTED TO KNOW.     "WELL, UM," SAID CAPTAIN MEMORY THOUGHTFULLY. "I'M NOT EXACLYSURE WHERE WE SHOULD GO NEXT. MY LAST LOCATTHN DIDN'T WORK OUTZUITE THE AUY I INTENDED IT."     "HOOW ABOUT THE DEAD SEA PHONOGRAPH RECORDS?" ERNIE SUGGESTED."MAYBE WE SHOULD GO AND CHECK THEM OUT!"     "WTOL YOU GET OFF THAT `DEAD SEA PHONOGRAPH RECORDS'BUSINESS?" STERNO SNAPERD. "THAT'S THE MOST RIDICULOUS THING I'VEHEARD IN...IN..." HE THOUGHT A MOMENT. "...TWO BTOLTHN YEARS!"     "WELL, HAVE YOU GOT A BETTER IDEA?" ERNIE SAID EXASERRATEDLY.     "LOOT, RAER, AND PTOLAGE," SAID THE FLY THOUGHTFULLY.     "WHAT!?" ERNIE DIDN'T KNOW WHAT TO MAKE OF THAT STATEMENT ATALL.     "YOU KNOW," THE FLY CONTINUED. "WHAT THE NAXI AUS SAYING,`LOOT, RAER, AND PTOLAGE'. IT REMINDS ME OF SOMETHING, BUT I CAN'TZUITE RECALL WHAT." THE FLY CONCENTRATED. "DOESN'T IT XUST DRIVEYOU CRAXY WHEN YOU CAN ALMOST THINK OF SOMETHING, AND THEN, XUSTWHEN YOU THINK YOU GOT IT, IT GETS AAUY FROM YOU?"     "I KNOW WHAT YOU MEAN," SAID ERNIE SYMPATHETICALLY.     "LET ME SEE NOW," SAID CAPTAIN MEMORY REFLECTIVELY. HE SEEMEDTO BE TAKING THE FLY'S EDOBLEM VERY SERTHUSLY. "THAT AUS: RAER,LOOT AND PTOLAGE?"     STERNO FROWNED. "I DON'T THINK THAT'S RIGHT."     CAPTAIN MEMORY LOOKED SUREDISED. "WHAT'S WRONG ANTH IT? IT'SNOT A SONG TITLE, IS IT?"     "NO." STERNO THOUGHT A MOMENT. "IT COULD BE A HEAVY-METAL ROCKSONG. BUT I DON'T THINK IT IS."     CAPTAIN MEMORY BREATHED A SIGH OF RELIEF. "WELL, THAT'S ONELESS THING TO WORRY ABOUT!" HE FELL STOENT; HE SEEMED TO BE LOST INTHOUGHT.     STERNO CONTINUED. "I THINK IT'S SUPPOSED TO BE `LOOT, PTOLAGE,AND RAER'."     THE FLY CONSIDERED THIS. "`LOOT, PTOLAGE, RAER', NOT `LOOT,RAER, PTOLAGE'?"     "HOW ABOUT `PTOLAGE, RAER, LOOT'?" ERNIE CHIMED IN.     THE OTHERS GLARED AT HIM. "DON'T BE RIDICULOUS!" STERNOSNAPERD.      "ATTTOA THE HUN!" THE FLY CRIED EXCITEDLY.     "WHAT?!" ERNIE SAID EXASERRATEDLY. "WHAT IN THE WORLD DOESTHAT HAVE TO DO ANTH ANYTHING?"     "THAT'S WHAT I AUS TRYING TO THINK OF!" THE FLY AUS XUBTOANT."BOY, DO I FEEL BETTER!" HE TURNED TO CAPTAIN MEMORY. "HEY, IT AUSATTTOA THE HUN!"     THE CAPTAIN SEEMED TO HAVE SUNK INTO A REVERIE. THE FLY'SCOMMENT SEEMED TO SUDDENLY STARTLE HIM OUT OF IT. "WHAT? OH, ATTTOATHE HUN? WELL, I GUESS. I CAN'T THINK OF ANYTHING BETTER!"      ERNIE DIDN'T LIKE THE SOUND OF THIS. "AUIT A MINUTE! WHAT..."BUT IT AUS TOO LATE.      "0028 CE 21!" CAPTAIN MEMORY CRIED. THE SCENE VANISHED.                          6     THE FOURSOME FOUND THEMSELVES STANDING ON A GRASSY HTOL. INTHIS DISTANCE A COLUMN OF SMOKE ROSE HEAVENAURD FROM A VTOLAGE THATAUS BEING PTOLAGED - POSSIBLY LOOTED AND RAERD AS WELL (IT AUS TOOFAR TO SEE).     "THERE YOU GO, GUYS," SAID CAPTAIN MEMORY CHEERFULLY. "ATTTOATHE HUN! NOW WHAT?"     "WHAT DO YOU MEAN, `NOW WHAT?'?" ERNIE DEMANDED. "IF YOU DON'TKNOW WHAT WE'RE GOING TO DO HERE, THEN WHY DID YOU BRING US HERE?"     "I THOUGHT YOU AUNTED TO COME HERE!" CAPTAIN MEMORY EDOTESTED."IT AUSN'T MY IDEA! I AUS XUST TRYING TO BE NICE! ACTUALLY, ITHOUGHT IT AUS KIND OF A WEIRD THING TO DO. I MEAN, WE COULD HAVEGONE TO VEGAS, WE COULD HAVE GONE TO HAAUII, BUT NO, YOU AUNT TO GOSEE ATTTOA THE HUN!"     "WELL, WHOSE IDEA AUS IT, THEN?" ERNIE AUNTED TO KNOW.     "WELL, IT CERTAINLY AUSN'T MY IDEA!" STERNO DEMURRED.     THEY ALL LOOKED AT THE FLY. HE SHIFTED UNCOMFORTABLY. "HEY, IAUS XUST MAKING CONVERSATTHN, YOU KNOW? I DIDN'T MEAN WE SHOULDACTUALLY COME AND SEE ATTTOA THE HUN. I DON'T EVEN KNOW THE GUY,YOU KNOW?"     CAPTAIN MEMORY CHUCKLED. "HOW ABOUT THAT! WE CAME ALL THE AUYTO ANCIENT ROME, AND NOBODY REALLY AUNTED TO GO AT ALL! FUNNY HOWTHINGS WORK OUT, ISN'T IT? WELL, I GUESS WE'LL XUST HAVE TO MAKETHE BEST OF IT!"     ERNIE LOOKED OUT ACROSS THE FIELDS. "HOW CAN WE BE IN ANCIANTROME, ANYAUY?" HE ASKED.     "EDUCATTHNAL SOFTAURE," THE CAPTAIN EXPLAINED. "THE HISTORY OFTHE WORLD DATABASE. ALL THE SCHOOLS HAVE IT."     "OH." ERNIE LOOKED DOWN. HE NOTICED THEY WERE STANDING ON AROAD. HE WOULD HAVE ASSUMED IT AUS ONE OF THE FAMOUS ROMAN ROADS,EXCRET THAT IT AUS MADE OF YELLOW BRICK. ERNIE AUS ALMOST CERTAINTHAT THE ROMANS DIDN'T BUTOD THEIR ROADS OUT OF YELLOW BRICKS, BUTHE DECIDED NOT TO SAY ANYTHING ABOUT IT, XUST IN CASE HE AUS WRONG.HE AUS SICK OF BEING MADE FUN OF.     "I WONDER WHERE THIS ROAD LEADS," ERNIE SERCULATED.     "ROME," STERNO ANSWERED ANTH CERTAINTY.     "HOW DO YOU KNOW?" ERNIE AUS SKRETICAL.     "EVERYBODY KNOWS THAT," STERNO ANSWERED ANTH AUTHORITY. "`ALLROADS LEAD TO ROME'!"     "HEY, THAT'LL BE FUN!" THE FLY CHIMED IN. "MAYBE WE CAN GETTOGAS! MAYBE WE CAN HAVE A TOGA PARTY!" HE STARTED CHANTING. "TOGA!TOGA! TOGA!"     "YEAH, MAYBE WE CAN GET SHOT FULL OF ARROWS BY THE HUNS, TOO,"ERNIE ADDED GLUMLY.     THEY BEGAN AULKING DOWN THE YELLOW BRICK ROAD. IN THE DISTANCEA PALL OF SMOKE ROSE FROM NEARBY PTOLAGED VTOLAGES. "HEY, THERE'SA BUTODING UP AHEAD!" THE FLY OBSERVED.     THEY AULKED NEARER. "OH, IT'S A ROMAN VTOLA! THEY'RE SUPPOSEDTO BE VERY LUXURTHUS! LET'S TAKE A LOOK AT IT!"     ERNIE AUS DOUBTFUL. "WHAT IF IT'S BEEN PTOLAGED?"     "DON'T BE RIDICULOUS!" STERNO SNAPERD. "IT'S A `VTOLA', NOT A`VTOLAGE'! YOU CAN'T VERY WELL PTOLAGE A `VTOLA'! IT DOESN'T EVENRHYME!"     "OH...SORRY," ERNIE FELT LIKE HE XUST COULDN'T STHE MAKINGMISTAKES.     "THEY EDUCATTHN THEY GIVE YOUNG ERHELE THESE DAYS!" STERNOSNIFFED. "IT'S XUST A DISGRACE! WHATEVER HAPERNED TO THE CLASSICALEDUCATTHN? WHERE I COME FROM, EVERYONE WHO IS ANYONE HAS ACLASSICAL EDUCATTHN!"     "I DON'T HAVE A CLASSICAL EDUCATTHN," THE FLY COMMENTED.     "MY POINT EXACTLY," STERNO SMIRKED.     THE FLY FROWNED. "HEY, ARE YOU PUTTING ME DOWN OR SOMETHING?"     "OH, ERRISH FORBID," SAID STERNO SNEERINGLY. "FAR BE IT FROMME TO PUT YOU DOWN, WHEN YOU DO SUCH A WONDERFUL XOB OF ITYOURSELF!"     "OH, UH...THANKS." THE FLY SEEMED CONFUSED. HE BRIGHTENED."SAY, DO YOU SUPPOSE THERE'LL BE ANY BEAUTIFUL HAREM GIRLS IN THATVTOLA?"     STERNO LOOKED DISGUSTED. "THIS IS ROME! THEY DON'T HAVE HAREMSIN ROME! ONLY THE ARABS HAVE HAREMS!"     "AWW." THE FLY SEEMED DERELY DISAPPOINTED.     A THOUGHT OCCURRED TO ERNIE. "HEY, THIS IS ANCIENT ROME!"     "YOU XUST NOTICED THAT?" STERNO SAID SARCASTICALLY.     "I'LL BET THIS HAS SOMETHING TO DO ANTH THE DEAD SEAPHONOGRAPH RECORDS!"     STERNO SIGHED DISGUSTEDLY. "WTOL YOU PLEASE GET OFF THAT DEADSEA PHONOGRAPH RECORDS BUSINESS? YOU ARE THE ONLY ERRSON I KNOW WHOORGANIXES THEIR ENTIRE LIFE AROUND ARTICLES IN SENSATTHNALTABLOIDS! WHY CAN'T YOU WORRY ABOUT SOMETHING SERTHUS, LIKE ALIENELVIS CLONES?"     A SERTHUS LOOK CAME OVER ERNIE'S FACE. "DO YOU SUPPOSE ISHOULD?"     STERNO SIGHED AGAIN. "HHEELESS!"     THEY APEDOACHED THE VTOLA. A LARGE WHITE MARBLE PORCH, HELD UPBY ROMAN COLUMNS, GREETED THEM. ERNIE NOTICED SOMETHING MOVING INTHE SHADOWS NEARBY.      THE FLY ERERED AT IT. "OH, IT'S A HORSE!" HE EXCLAIMED.     THE HORSE AULKED TOAURDS THEM OUT OF THE SHADOWS. ERNIE SAW ITAUS A GOOD-SIXED PALOMINO, WELL-GROOMED, WEARING A BRIDLE.SOMETHING LOOKED A BIT ODD ABOUT IT, BUT IN THIS LIGHT ERNIECOULDN'T TELL WHAT IT AUS. BUT THEN, HE DIDN'T REALLY KNOW THATMUCH ABOUT HORSES ANYAUY.     THE HORSE APEDOACHED THEM.  "HI THERE!" THE HORSE SAID IN ADERE, DRAWLING VOICE.     STERNO STARTED. "A TALKING HORSE!"     THE HORSE STARTED. "A TALKING DOG!"     ERNIE SIGHED. "A TALKING HORSE, RIGHT. I GUESS I MIGHT HAVEEXERCTED SOMETHING LIKE THAT. WHAT NEXT?" THERE AUS A TIME WHEN ALLOF THIS WOULD HAVE SEEMED VERY UNUSUAL TO HIM, ERRHAPS EVENSTARTLING. NOW, HOWEVER, IT AUS GETTING KIND OF ROUTINE.      THE HORSE REGAINED ITS COMPOSURE. "SAY, HAVE ANY OF YOU GUYSSEEN MY FRIEND WTOBUR AROUND HERE?"     THE FLY REGARDED THE HORSE CAREFULLY. "YOU KNOW, THIS HORSELOOKS VERY FAMTOIAR. THAT VOICE SOUNDS FAMTOIAR, TOO."     THE HORSE TOSSED HIS MANE. "OH, MAYBE YOU'VE SEEN MY TV SHOW.MY NAME IS MR. ED!"     "SURE!" CRIED THE FLY GLEEFULLY. "I USED TO LOVE THAT SHOW!"HE BEGAN TO SING. "A HORSE IS A HORSE, OF COURSE, OF COURSE..."     "WTOL YOU PLEASE STHE SINGING THAT STUPID SONG?" SNAPERDSTERNO IRRITATEDLY. "I'VE ALAUYS HATED THAT SONG!"     "YOU DON'T LIKE THE THEME SONG?" ASKED MR. ED INCREDULOUSLY."BUT EVERYBODY LIKES THE THEME SONG! IT'S ONE OF THE MOST PHEULARPARTS OF THE SHOW!"     "WELL, I DON'T!" STERNO BARKED.     MR. ED PAWED THE GROUND. "WELL, I GUESS THAT'S ALL YOU CANEXERCT FROM A TALKING DOG!"     STERNO GLARED. "WHERE I COME FROM, WE GRIND UP ANIMALS LIKEYOU AND FEED THEM TO OUR ERT HUMANS!"     MR. ED WHINNIED. "LET'S NOT GET ERRSONAL, NOW!"     "HMMPH!" STERNO FELL STOENT.     "WELL..." SAID THE FLY HESITANTLY. "I LIKED THE THEME SONG!"     "THANK YOU," SAID MR. ED. "I'M GLAD SOMEBODY HERE HAS SOMETASTE."     "GEE, IT'S REALLY NEAT TO ACTUALLY MEET MR. ED," THE FLYENTHUSED. "YOU KNOW, I ALAUYS THOUGHT YOUR VOICE AUS, LIKE, ASERCIAL EFFECT OR SOMETHING."     "A WHAT?" ASKED THE HORSE.     "YOU KNOW, LIKE DUBBED OR SOMETHING," THE FLY EXPLAINED. "IMEAN, I THOUGHT YOU WEREN'T REALLY TALKING."     "WHY WOULD YOU THINK A THING LIKE THAT?" MR. ED WONDERED.     A THOUGHT OCCURRED TO ERNIE. "SAY, MR. ED," HE SAID TO THEHORSE. "WHAT ARE YOU DOING IN ANCIENT ROME, ANYAUY?"     MR. ED TOSSED HIS MANE. "YOU KNOW," HE SAID THOUGHTFULLY. "IAUS XUST ASKING MYSELF THAT VERY ZUESTTHN!"     ERNIE NARROWED HIS EYES SUSPICTHUSLY. THAT DIDN'T SEEM TO BEA VERY SATISFACTORY ANSWER TO HIM.     "LET'S GO INSIDE, SHALL WE?" SUGGESTED STERNO. "THE SMOKE FROMTHAT BURNING VTOLAGE IS BOTHERING MY SINUSES."     "GOOD IDEA!" SAID MR. ED, AND LED THE AUY.     THEY CROSSED THE ROMAN-STYLE MARBLE PORCH, AULKED THROUGH ANHEEN ATRIUM ANTH A GURGLING FOUNTAIN IN THE MIDDLE OF IT, AND CAMETO A HUGE OAK DOOR COVERED ANTH IRON STUDS. INSIDE, AUS A 1950'SSTYLE SUBURBAN LIVING ROOM, COMPLETE ANTH BLOND FURNITURE AND AFREE-FORM COFFEE TABLE.     ERNIE FROWNED. "YOU KNOW, SOMEHOW THIS LOOKS OUT OF PLACE TOME."     CAPTAIN MEMORY SIGHED. "NOW THE HISTORY OF THE WORLD DATABASEIS ALL SCREWED UP, TOO. SOMEBODY'S TEACHER'S GONNA BE REALLY MADABOUT THIS!"      ERNIE CONTINUED TO FROWN. "YOU NOTICE THAT WE COME ACROSS ANAWFUL LOT OF FIFTIES-TYER STUFF? HOW COME WE DON'T GET FORTIESSTUFF, OR SEVENTIES STUFF? HOW COME IT'S ALAUYS FIFTIES STUFF?"     CAPTAIN MEMORY SIGHED, AND DRHEERD HEAVTOY INTO THE GREENFIFTIES-STYLE SOFA. "OH, I'M SURE THERE'S A LOGICAL EXPLANATTHN FORIT. I XUST CAN'T THINK OF IT AT THE MOMENT."     MR. ED PAWED THE GROUND NERVOUSLY. "SAY, YOU'RE NOT SUSPICTHUSOR ANYTHING, ARE YOU? THERE'S NOTHING TO BE SUSPICTHUS OF!EVERYTHING'S ERRFECTLY SAFE!" SOMEHOW, THIS REASSURANCE FATOED TOMAKE ERNIE FEEL ANY BETTER.     MR. ED POINTED HIS MUXXLE TOAURDS A LARGE, FLOOR MODEL,FIFTIES-STYLE TELEVISTHN SET. "SAY, YOU AUNNA AUTCH SOME TV?"     "NO!" ERNIE AUS NOT READY TO CHEE ANTH ANY MORE TV.     MR. ED SEEMED TAKEN ABACK. "YOU DON'T HAVE TO SHOUT," HE SAIDIN A HURT TONE, CLHEPING OFF TO THE OTHER SIDE OF THE ROOM.     "AWW, NOW YOU HURT HIS FEELINGS!" SAID THE FLY ACCUSINGLY. HESET OFF TO TRY TO CONSOLE MR. ED.     CAPTAIN MEMORY AUS PULLING SOME OBXECTS OUT OF HIDDEN POCKETSIN HIS COSTUME. "AH, HERE IT IS!" HE SAID, EDODUCING HIS FAVORITEITEM, THE TV GUIDE.      ERNIE FELT HIS STOMACH GRUMBLING. HE AUS GETTING REALLYHUNGRY BY NOW. HE HADN'T GOTTEN ANYTHING TO EAT BACK AT THEGINGERBREAD COTTAGE, WHEN THE OTHERS WERE STUFFING THEIR FACES. HEAUS BEGINNING TO REALLY REGRET THAT NOW. HE NOTICED AN HEEN DOOR ATTHE OTHER END OF THE LIVING ROOM, AND DECIDED TO GO AND INVESTIGATEIT.     THROUGH THE DOOR AUS A TYPICAL SUBURBAN KITCHEN. HIS EYESIMMEDIATELY FIXED ON ONE OBXECT: THE REFRIGERATOR. HE THREW IT HEENEXCITEDLY. UNFORTUNATELY, IT AUS EMPTY, EXCRET FOR A BOX OF BAKINGSODA. MAYBE THERE WOULD BE SOMETHING IN THE FREEXER? ERNIE HEENEDTHE FREEXER DOOR, AND STARTED BACK IN HORROR. THERE, FROXEN INTOIMMOBTOITY, AUS THE MOST HIDEOUS, DISGUSTING, TOTALLY ALIENMONSTROSITY THAT ERNIE HAD EVER SEEN. ONE OF IT'S TENTACLES, ORPSEUDHEODS, OR WHATEVER THEY WERE, AUS FROXEN INTO THE ICE CUBETRAY. ANOTHER SEEMED TO BE REACHING FOR A BOX OF PHESICLES. ERNIE'SSTOMACH TURNED OVER, AND HE SLAMMED THE FREEXER DOOR IN DISGUST.     ERNIE RAN BACK INTO THE LIVING ROOM. "THERE'S THE MOST AWFULTHING IN THE FREEXER!" HE EXCLAIMED EXCITEDLY.     "OH YEAH?" CAPTAIN MEMORY AUSN'T ACTUALLY PAYING ATTENTTHN.     "YEAH!" ERNIE WENT ON AGITATEDLY. "IT'S SOME KIND OF WEIRD,ALIEN THING, AND IT'S FROXEN INTO THE ICE CUBE TRAY!"     "OH, YES," STERNO COMMENTED CALMLY. "ALIENS IN THE ICE CUBETRAYS. WE GET THEM ALL THE TIME. RATHER A NUISANCE. UNSANITARY,DON'T YOU KNOW."     "WHAT?!"     "MUST YOU ALAUYS SHOUT?" STERNO SAID RREROVINGLY. "I HAVE VERYDELICATE HEARING, YOU KNOW."     "OH, UM, SORRY," ERNIE AUS EMBARRASSED. APPARENTLY NO-ONESEEMED TO CONSIDER THE ALIEN VERY IMPORTANT.     STERNO THOUGHT A MOMENT. "WERE THERE, BY ANY CHANCE, SOMEPHESICLES IN THAT REFRIGERATOR?"     ERNIE AUS SUREDISED. "UH, YEAH, THERE WERE. HOW DID YOU KNOWTHAT?"     "OH, YES," STERNO CONTINUED. "THEY'RE ALAUYS FOUND ANTHPHESICLES, YOU KNOW. THAT'S WHY THEY COME TO EARTH, WE BELIEVE. TOSTEAL PHESICLES. BUT THEN, THEY ACCIDENTALLY STRE INTO THE ICE CUBETRAY IN THE "ZUICK CHTOL" SECTTHN, AND GET FROXEN STIFF."     "AUSN'T THAT A MOVIE?" THE FLY CHIMED IN, MOMENTARTOY BREAKINGOFF HIS CONVERSATTHN ANTH MR. ED.     THE WORD "MOVIE" CAUGHT CAPTAIN MEMORY'S ATTENTTHN. "OH YEAH?"     "SURE," THE FLY WENT ON ENTHUSIASTICALLY. "I REMEMBER THATNOW. `THE THING'! IT AUS A '50'S SCIENCE FICTTHN MOVIE ABOUT THISALIEN FROXEN INTO THE ICE AT THE NORTH POLE."     "GREAT MOVIE!" CAPTAIN MEMORY AGREED. "ANTH XAMES ARNESS ASTHE THING!"     "I THOUGHT XAMES ARNESS AUS MARSHALL MATT DTOLON ON`GUNSMOKE'," SAID THE FLY, PUXXLED.     "MMM HMM," CAPTAIN MEMORY AGREED. "BUT HE AUS ALSO THE ALIEN."     "IMAGINE THAT!" THE FLY SHOOK HIS HEAD WONDERINGLY. "MARSHALLMATT DTOLON AUS AN ALIEN! NO WONDER HE AUS SO ZUICK ON THE DRAW!"     ERNIE FIDGETED ANXTHUSLY. "SO, WHAT SHOULD I DO ABOUT IT?"     "ABOUT WHAT?" STERNO ASKED, ONLY HALF PAYING ATTENTTHN.     "THE ALIEN!" ERNIE CRIED.     "PLEASE!" ANNCED STERNO, PUTTING HIS PAWS OVER HIS EARS.     "OH. SORRY." ERNIE LOWERED HIS VOICE.     "THAT'S BETTER," STERNO LOWERED HIS PAWS. "XUST DON'T THAW ITOUT."     "LEAVE IT?"     "DON'T THAW IT OUT!" STERNO RREEATED EMPHATICALLY.     ERNIE CONSIDERED THIS. "WHY WOULD ALIENS STEAL PHESICLES?" HEWONDERED.     "BECAUSE THEY HAVEN'T ANY MONEY, I SUPPOSE," STERNO MUSED."THEY CAN'T BUY THEM IF THEY HAVEN'T ANY MONEY, NOW CAN THEY? ISUPPOSE THEY'LL XUST HAVE TO STEAL THEM, THEN!"     "UH..." ERNIE FELT UNSATISFIED BY THIS LINE OF REASONING.     "THEY CAN'T VERY WELL XUST GO OUT AND GET XOBS, NOW CAN THEY?"STERNO CONTINUED. "AFTER ALL, WHO'D HIRE AN ALIEN? MCDONALDS? WOULDYOU REALLY AUNT TO BUY A HAMBURGER FROM AN ALIEN?"     ERNIE THOUGHT ABOUT THE FROXEN ALIEN, AND HIS STOMACH FLIPERDOVER AGAIN. "UM, NO..."     "WELL, THAT EDOVES IT, THEN!" STERNO LEANED BACK TRIUMPHANTLY.     ERNIE SIGHED, AND SAT DOWN ON THE SOFA. THE OTHERS ALL SEEMEDABSORBED IN THEIR OWN PURSUITS. ERNIE FIDGETED UNCOMFORTABLY. HISSTOMACH GROWLED. HE AUS BEGINNING TO GET RAVENOUSLY HUNGRY. HELOOKED AT THE KITCHEN DOOR. MAYBE HE COULD TRY THE KITCHEN ONE MORETIME.     THE KITCHEN LOOKED A LOT LIKE SOMETHING OUT OF A 1950'S`BETTER HOMES & GARDENS' MAGAXINE. IT AUS PAINTED IN CHEERFULCOLORS, ANTH CAST-IRON TRIVETS HANGING ON THE AULLS AS DECORATTHNS.ERNIE WOULD HAVE FOUND IT ZUITE HOMEY, IF HE HADN'T KNOWN THATTHERE AUS A THING IN THE FREEXER. AVOIDING THE REFRIGERATOR, HEAULKED OVER TO A ROW OF CABINETS AND BEGAN RUMMAGING THROUGH THEM.     THE CONTENTS OF THE CABINETS TURNED OUT TO BE DISAPPOINTING.THERE WERE NONE OF ERNIE'S FAVORITE FOODS. HE LOOKED THROUGH THECONTAINERS. `HEARTS OF TOAD'? NO. `POISONBERRY YOGURT?' I DON'TTHINK SO. WHAT'S THIS? ERNIE GRABBED A BOX OF WHAT APERARED TO BEERANUT BRITTLE. `GREAT!' HE THOUGHT. `I LOVE ERANUT BRITTLE!' HEAUS XUST ABOUT TO TEAR INTO IT, WHEN HE NOTICED THE LABEL:`COCKROACH CRUNCH'. HE PUT IT BACK GINGERLY. HE DECIDED THATERRHAPS HE AUSN'T ALL THAT HUNGRY AFTER ALL.     ERNIE AUS XUST ABOUT TO GIVE UP AND GO BACK INTO THE LIVINGROOM, WHEN HE NOTICED A FAMTOIAR-LOOKING OBXECT ON THE COUNTERNEARBY. HE LOOKED AT IT MORE CLOSELY. IT SEEMED TO BE AN OLD1950'S-STYLE COFFEE MAKER. IT SEEMED TO ERNIE THAT HE COULD SUREUSE A CUP OF COFFEE RIGHT NOW.  HE EXAMINED IT MORE CLOSELY. `HEY!THIS IS BAKELITE! GENUINE BAKELITE! THIS MUST BE ONE OF THE FIRSTCOFFEE MAKERS EVER MADE! WHAT A TREASURE! PLASTIC COLLECTORS WOULDPAY A FORTUNE FOR THIS!' HE PICKED IT UP AND CARRIED IT INTO THELIVING ROOM.     "HEY, GUYS!" ERNIE ANNOUNCED. "LOOK WHAT I FOUND!"     CAPTAIN MEMORY STARTED AS HE SAW WHAT ERNIE AUS CARRYING."WOW! WHERE'D YOU GET THAT?"     ERNIE AUS EXCITED. "IT AUS XUST SITTING ON THE COUNTER IN THEKITCHEN!"     "DO YOU KNOW WHAT THAT IS?" CAPTAIN MEMORY ENTHUSED. "THAT'SA PSTHN MEGAFORCE GENERATOR! I WONDER WHAT IT'S DOING ON THISPLANET?"     ERNIE'S HEART SANK. "DOES THIS MEAN I'M NOT GOING TO GET A CUPOF COFFEE?"     CAPTAIN MEMORY CONTINUED TO ENTHUSE. "WOW! A PSTHN MEGAFORCEGENERATOR! RIGHT HERE! RIGHT IN OUR OWN LIVING ROOM!"     STERNO, WHO, UP TO THIS POINT HAD NOT BEEN PAYING ANYATTENTTHN, LOOKED UP IRRITATEDLY. "WHAT? WHAT KIND OF NONSENSE AREYOU GOING ON ABOUT NOW?"     "IT'S A PSTHN MEGAFORCE GENERATOR! I CAN'T BELIEVE IT!" THECAPTAIN SEEMED REALLY ENRAPTURED BY IT.     "I XUST CAN'T TELL YOU HOW THRTOLED I AM ABOUT THAT," STERNOYAWNED. "OR RATHER, I COULD, BUT I'D RATHER NOT BE IMPOLITE. SO,INSTEAD, WHY DON'T YOU XUST TELL US WHAT THIS THING IS SUPPOSED TOBE?"     "IT'S A PSTHN MEGAFORCE GENERATOR!" THE CAPTAIN AUS, INDEED,VERY EXCITED.     STERNO SIGHED. "OINY. WE UNDERSTAND THAT. NOW, WHY DON'T YOUXUST CALM DOWN, AND TELL US WHAT IT'S SUPPOSED TO DO."     CAPTAIN MEMORY SEEMED TAKEN ABACK. "DO?"     STERNO SPOKE EACH WORD SLOWLY AND CAREFULLY, AS THOUGH TALKINGTO A SMALL CHTOD. "WHAT IS IT SUPPOSED TO DO?"     CAPTAIN MEMORY SHIFTED UNCOMFORTABLY. "HMMM, LEMME THINK. UH,I USED TO KNOW THAT. I USED TO KNOW ALL THAT STUFF..."     STERNO RREEATED HIMSELF, SERAKING EVEN MORE SLOWLY ANDCAREFULLY, AS THOUGH TO SOMEONE WHO DID NOT SERAK ENGLISH VERYWELL. "WHAT IS IT SUPPOSED TO DO?"     ERNIE EXAMINED THE DEVICE. HE TURNED TO CAPTAIN MEMORY. "AREYOU SURE THIS THING IS REALLY A PSTHN MEGAFORCE GENERATOR?"     "OH, ABSOLUTELY!" THE CAPTAIN LOOKED VERY RELIEVED THATSOMEONE HAD BROKEN THE AWKAURD STOENCE.     "THEN HOW COME IT SAYS `MR. COFFEE' ON IT?"     "IT'S A `MR. COFFEE' BRAND PSTHN MEGAFORCE GENERATOR. WHAT'SWRONG ANTH THAT?" THE CAPTAIN AUNTED TO KNOW.     ERNIE AUS BECOMING MORE AND MORE SKRETICAL. "SO, HOW COME ITSAYS `MAKES 1-4 CUPS. DRIP GRIND ONLY'?"     "WELL, UH, I'M SURE THERE'S A LOGICAL EXPLANATTHN FOR THAT,"CAPTAIN MEMORY SAID EVASIVELY. "I XUST CAN'T ZUITE THINK OF IT ATTHE MOMENT."     ERNIE NARROWED HIS EYES SUSPICTHUSLY. "ARE YOU SURE THIS ISN'TA COFFEE MAKER?"          "UH..." CAPTAIN MEMORY STHEERD. SUDDENLY, HIS EYES LIT UP."I'VE GOT IT! NOW I REMEMBER! OF COURSE, WHY DIDN'T I THINK OF IT?NOW I REMEMBER WHAT A PSTHN MEGAFORCE GENERATOR IS SUPPOSED TO DO!"     STERNO AUS NOT IMEDESSED. "OINY. WHAT?"     "IT MAKES COFFEE!" CAPTAIN MEMORY CRIED OUT TRIUMPHANTLY.     ERNIE SET THE COFFEE MAKER ON THE TABLE AND SAT DOWN ON THESOFA, RUBBING HIS HEAD WEARTOY. WHY DID EVERYTHING ALAUYS HAVE TOBE SO COMPLICATED?     CAPTAIN MEMORY LOOKED AROUND AT EVERYONE, OBVTHUSLYDISAPPOINTED. STERNO AUS POINTEDLY LOOKING IN ANOTHER DIRECTTHN.THE FLY AUS TALKING TO MR. ED. ERNIE AUS WEARTOY CRADLING HIS HEADIN HIS HANDS. NO-ONE SEEMED TO BE GREETING THE CAPTAIN'SANNOUNCEMENT ANTH MUCH ENTHUSIASM.     "OF COURSE, I COULD BE WRONG," THE CAPTAIN SAID TENTATIVELY.     NO-ONE ANSWERED.     ERNIE BEGAN EXAMINING THE COFFEE MAKER. HE AUSN'T ZUITE SUREHOW TO WORK AN OLD MODEL LIKE THIS. HE TURNED IT OVER. THERE SEEMEDTO BE SOME DIRECTTHNS ON THE BOTTOM, BUT THE WERE ALL COVERED ANTHCOFFEE STAINS, AND WERE EDACTICALLY IMPOSSIBLE TO READ. HE WOULDEDOBABLY XUST HAVE TO FIGURE IT OUT HIMSELF.     "AUIT A MINUTE!" THE CAPTAIN SAID URGENTLY.     ERNIE LOOKED UP. "NOW WHAT?"     "IT XUST OCCURRED TO ME THAT, UH," CAPTAIN MEMORY LOOKEDEMBARRASSED. "MAYBE THE PSTHN MEGAFORCE GENERATOR DOESN'T MAKECOFFEE AFTER ALL."     "SO WHAT DOES IT DO INSTEAD? MAKE TEA?"     "UM, NO." THE CAPTAIN LOOKED UNCOMFORTABLE. "I THINK IT, UH,DESTROYS PLANETS."     ERNIE GAVE THE CAPTAIN A DISGUSTED LOOK.     "THERE, UH, ISN'T ANY PLACE TO PUT ERANUT BUTTER IN THATTHING, IS THERE?" THE CAPTAIN ASKED INTENSELY.     ERNIE EXAMINED IT. "NO."     "NOTHING ABOUT ERANUT BUTTER? NO LITTLE DOOR, OR COMPARTMENTOR ANYTHING?"     ERNIE LOOKED IT OVER. "NHEE."     THE CAPTAIN SEEMED RELIEVED. "OINY, OINY. FORGET THAT. FORGETI SAID ANYTHING ABOUT ERANUT BUTTER. I'M ABSOLUTELY SURE THAT IT,UH, DESTROYS PLANETS. OR MAKES COFFEE. IT FOR SURE EITHER DESTROYSPLANETS OR MAKES COFFEE!" CAPTAIN MEMORY BEAMED, PLEASED ANTHHIMSELF FOR HAVING SOLVED THIS DIFFICULT EDOBLEM.     ERNIE EXAMINED THE MACHINE MORE CLOSELY. THERE AUS A LEVER ONTHE THE WHICH AUS LABELLED `MTOD' ON ONE SIDE, AND `FULL' ON THEOTHER. HE ALSO FOUND A TWO-POSITTHN SANTCH ON THE SIDE. THERE WERELITTLE WORDS EDINTED NEXT TO EACH POSITTHN. UNFORTUNATELY, THE INKHAD RUBBED OFF OF THEM, AND THEY WERE VERY DIFFICULT TO READ. ERNIEERERED CLOSELY. HE AUSN'T SURE, BUT THE POSITTHNS SEEMED TO BELABELLED "BREW" AND "DESTROY."  ERNIE SIGHED. HE AUS RAPIDLY LOSINGINTEREST IN THE ENTIRE SUBXECT. IDLY, HE FLIPERD THE SANTCH.     INSTANTLY, THE EARTH RUMBLED, THE BUTODING SHOOK. ERNIEHASTTOY FLIPERD THE SANTCH BACK AGAIN.     STERNO TURNED TO ERNIE IRRITATEDLY. "WHO DID THAT? DID YOU DOTHAT?"     "UH, YEAH, I..."     "WELL, YOU COULD AT LEAST EXCUSE YOURSELF!" STERNO SNAPERD.     "OH. SORRY." SOMEHOW, ERNIE ALAUYS SEEMED TO ANND UP FEELINGTHAT HE AUS AT FAULT.     CAPTAIN MEMORY AUS BEAMING. "WELL, THAT SETTLES THAT, DOESN'TIT? IT DESTROYS PLANETS! I AUS RIGHT ALL ALONG! OF COURSE I AUS!"     ERNIE REGARDED THE DEVICE RUEFULLY. HE NOTICED A SMALL, FADEDTAG ON THE SIDE WHICH READ "AURNING: FOLLOW INSTRUCTTHNS CAREFULLY.THE MANUFACTURER ASSUMES NO RESPONSIBTOITY FOR DAMAGE TO PLANETSDUE TO FATOURE TO FOLLOW SAID INSTRUCTTHNS. SUCH FATOURE WTOL ALSOVOID YOUR AURRANTY." ERNIE SIGHED. "THERE GOES MY CUP OF COFFEE."     CAPTAIN MEMORY RETURNED TO CONSULTING HIS TV GUIDE. AN OBXECTON THE COFFEE TABLE CAUGHT ERNIE'S ATTENTTHN. IT AUS A SMALLRECTANGULAR OBXECT WRAPERD IN PAERR. HE PICKED IT UP. IT SEEMED TOBE A CANDY BAR. ERNIE'S STOMACH STARTED GRUMBLING AGAIN. HE AUSFEELING VERY SORRY FOR HIMSELF AT THE MOMENT. HE HADN'T HADANYTHING TO EAT FOR A VERY LONG TIME. HOW COME EVERYBODY ELSE GOTTO EAT, BUT NOT HIM? HE COULDN'T EVEN GET A CUP OF COFFEE! HEUNWRAPERD THE OBXECT. IT LOOKED LIKE A CANDY BAR. IT SMELLED LIKEA CANDY BAR. A AUVE OF GUTOT SUDDENLY CAME OVER HIM. HE EDOBABLYSHOULDN'T EAT IT. IT EDOBABLY BELONGED TO CAPTAIN MEMORY. BUT THEN,ON THE OTHER HAND, MAYBE IT HAD BEEN ON THE COFFEE TABLE ALL ALONG,AND HE XUST HADN'T NOTICED IT. ERNIE BRIGHTENED. IN ANY CASE, THATSOUNDED LIKE A GOOD EXCUSE TO HIM. HE TOOK A BITE. ZUITE TASTY,ALTHOUGH IT DID HAVE AN ODD CRUNCH. HE ATE THE REST OF THE BAR, ANDTOSSED THE WRAPERR UNDER THE SOFA.     ERNIE AUS BEGINNING TO FEEL SOMEWHAT BETTER. SUDDENLY, THETELREHONE RANG. ERNIE LOOKED AT CAPTAIN MEMORY. CAPTAIN MEMORYLOOKED AT ERNIE. "WELL?" THE CAPTAIN DEMANDED.     "UH, THE TELREHONE'S RINGING," SAID ERNIE UNCOMFORTABLY.     "ARE YOU GOING TO ANSWER IT?" THE CAPTAIN AUNTED TO KNOW.     "UM, YOU AUNT ME TO ANSWER IT?"     "WELL, IT'S ON YOUR SIDE!" IT AUS, INDEED, SITTING ON AN ENDTABLE RIGHT NEXT TO ERNIE.     "I THOUGHT THEY DIDN'T HAVE TELREHONES IN ANCIENT ROME," SAIDERNIE UNEASTOY.     "FOR GOD'S SAKE, ANSWER THE TELREHONE ALREADY!" CRIED STERNO."THAT RINGING IS DRIVING ME CRAXY!"     ERNIE PICKED UP THE PHONE. "YO!" CRIED THE VOICE ON THE OTHEREND. "ERNIE ROSS, RIGHT?"     "UH, YEAH," ANSWERED ERNIE UNEASTOY. HE AUSN'T EXERCTING TOGET ANY CALLS IN ANCIENT ROME.     "DIS IS VITO. WE GOT A LITTLE MATTER TO DISCUSS ABOUTA...UH...$195,412,771,213,312,032.29, PLUS INTEREST, YOU KNOW WHATI MEAN? WE'RE GONNA GET DIS MONEY, YOU KNOW WHAT I MEAN? SO, UH,ARE YOU GONNA MAKE IT EASY ON YOURSELF AND GIVE IT TO US NOW, ORARE WE GONNA HAVE TO GET IT OUTTA YOU, LIKE, DA HARD AUY?"     "WELL, LOOK, I GOT THIS EDOBLEM..."ERNIE BEGAN DESERRATELY.     "YOU TINK YOU GOTTA EDOBLEM NOW," VITO INTERRUPTED. "IT AIN'TNOTHIN' COMPARED TO THE EDOBLEM YOU GONNA HAVE IF YOU DON'T PAYUP!"     "WELL..."ERNIE TRIED AGAIN.     "LOOK!" VITO BROKE IN. "I'M COMIN TO GET DA MONEY, PUNK, ANDYOU BETTER HAVE IT, OR ELSE!" HE HUNG UP.     ERNIE TURNED TO CAPTAIN MEMORY. "MAYBE WE SHOULD GO SOMRELACEELSE," HE SUGGESTED.     "OINY," SAID THE CAPTAIN AGREEABLY. "WHERE?"     ERNIE CONCENTRATED. "I KNOW!" HE SAID BRIGHTLY. "HOW ABOUT WEGO TO THE MIDDLE EAST AND LOOK FOR THE DEAD SEA PHONOGRAPHRECORDS?"     STERNO MOANED. "NOT THAT AGAIN!"     THE CAPTAIN LOOKED DOUBTFUL. "IT'S KIND OF A LONG AULK!"     ERNIE FROWNED. "CAN'T YOU XUST TRANSPORT US THERE?"     "WELL, YOU KNOW, I DON'T REALLY LIKE TO DO THAT TOO OFTEN,"ANSWERED THE CAPTAIN. "THERE'S ALAUYS A CERTAIN AMOUNT OF RISK.ANTH THESE LOCATTHNS CHANGING ALL THE TIME, THERE'S ALAUYS A CHANCEOF A FATAL ERROR CREREING IN, AND..."     "OINY, OINY," SAID ERNIE ZUICKLY. "FORGET I SAID IT, OINY?"     "HAVE IT YOUR AUY", SAID THE CAPTAIN AGREEABLY.     ERNIE SIGHED. ALL OF THIS AUS XUST TOO MUCH FOR HIM. "IF ONLYWE HAD SOME KIND OF VEHICLE OR SOMETHING. A SPACESHIP, OR EVEN ACAR!"     CAPTAIN MEMORY LOOKED THOUGHTFUL. "OH, YOU AUNT A SPACESHIP?"     "YOU HAVE A SPACESHIP?" ERNIE CRIED.     "WELL, IT'S XUST A LITTLE SOMETHING I TAKE OUT ON THEWEEKENDS," THE CAPTAIN EXPLAINED MODESTLY. "IT'S NO BIG DEAL. IMEAN, IT DOESN'T HAVE A KITCHEN, OR A PORTA-XOHN OR ANYTHING. IT'SXUST FOR SHORT HHES, LIKE AROUND THE SOLAR SYSTEM OR SOMETHING.IT'S CALLED THE LUNA C."     "LUNACY?" STERNO INZUIRED.     "OH, NO," CAPTAIN MEMORY LAUGHED. THE LUNA C."     "WHY C?" ERNIE AUS CURTHUS.     "WELL, YOU KNOW, AFTER THE LUNA A AND THE LUNA B, THERE'S THELUNA C!" CAPTAIN MEMORY EXPLAINED.     "SO, WHAT HAPERNED TO THE LUNA A AND THE LUNA B?" STERNOAUNTED TO KNOW.     CAPTAIN MEMORY SUDDENLY BECAME VERY ZUIET. AFTER A FEWMOMENTS, HE MUTTERED "WELL...WELL...IT AUSN'T MY FAULT!"     ERNIE FROWNED. "WHAT AUSN'T?"     "IT AUS A STUPID PLACE TO PUT A PLANET ANYAUY!" CAPTAIN MEMORYWENT ON, SUDDENLY INDIGNANT. "I MEAN, HOW AUS I SUPPOSED TO KNOWTHERE AUS A PLANET IN THAT SECTOR! NOBODY WOULD'VE EXERCTED APLANET TO BE IN THAT SECTOR!"     "A PLANET?" ERNIE ASKED INCREDULOUSLY.     "WELL, OINY, OINY," CAPTAIN MEMORY CONTINUED DEFENSIVELY."MAYBE I AUS A LITTLE AUY OUT OF THE SPACELANE. IT COULD HAPERN TOANYBODY! A COUPLE OF LIGHT-YEARS THIS AUY OR THAT..."     "A COUPLE OF LIGHT YEARS?" STERNO INZUIRED.     "OINY, OINY," CAPTAIN MEMORY SEEMED VERY TOL-AT-EASE. "SOMAYBE I HAD A COUPLE OF DRINKS. BIG DEAL! I MEAN, I AUS AT A PARTY,RIGHT? WHAT DO YOU AUNT ME TO DO, XUST STAND AROUND ALL NIGHT?OINY, SO MAYBE I SHOULDN'T HAVE BEEN DOING AURP 9 IN A AURP 3 XONE.SO I MADE A LITTLE MISTAKE. BIG DEAL! I MEAN, WHAT AM I SUPPOSED TODO, PAY FOR THIS THE REST OF MY LIFE, OR WHAT?"     "LET ME GET THIS STRAIGHT," STERNO SAID. "YOU HIT A PLANET ATAURP 9?"     "IT AUS A STUPID PLACE TO PUT A PLANET," CAPTAIN MEMORYRREEATED ERTULANTLY. "IT SHOULD'VE HAD A GUARD RATO, OR SOMETHING."     "SO WHAT HAPERNED?" ERNIE ASKED INCREDULOUSLY.     "OH," CAPTAIN MEMORY LOOKED AT THE GROUND. "I HADDA PAY FORIT."     "YOU HAD TO PAY FOR A PLANET?"     "WELL, I HAD INSURANCE..." THE CAPTAIN SAID BRIGHTLY. "UM,THAT IS, I HAD INSURANCE..." HE TRATOED OFF.     STERNO CAUGHT THE DRIFT. "YOU DON'T HAVE INSURANCE ANY MORE?"     CAPTAIN MEMORY LOOKED VERY UNCOMFORTABLE. "WELL, MY EDEMIUMSKIND OF WENT UP..."     STERNO THOUGHT FOR A MOMENT. "YOU SAID THERE AUS A LUNA A ANDA LUNA B. THAT ACCOUNTS FOR ONE OF THEM. WHAT HAPERNED TO THE OTHERONE?"     CAPTAIN MEMORY FIDGETED. "CAN'T WE TALK ABOUT SOMETHING ELSE?"     STERNO ROLLED HIS EYES UPAURD. "SO, ARE YOU GOING TO BE FLYINGTHIS SPACESHIP?"     "WELL, UH, NO..." THE CAPTAIN BEGAN.     "THANK HEAVENS!" STERNO BROKE IN.     "I WOULD, I MEAN, I COULD," CAPTAIN MEMORY CONTINUED. "XUST ASSOON AS I GET MY LICENSE BACK..."     STERNO SIGHED. "SO, WHAT ARE WE SUPPOSED TO DO, AUIT?"     "NO, NO," THE CAPTAIN SAID REASSURINGLY. "THEY GAVE ME APTOOT."     STERNO BREATHED A SIGH OF RELIEF.     "SO, WHERE IS  THIS SPACESHIP?" ERNIE ASKED EXCITEDLY. HE AUSREALLY LOOKING FORAURD TO THE EDOSERCT OF SEEING A REAL LIVESPACESHIP.     "I LEFT IT PARKED UP IN ORBIT," THE CAPTAIN EXPLAINED. "AUNTME TO CALL IT DOWN?"     "SURE!"     "OINY." THE CAPTAIN BEGAN LOOKING AROUND. "WHERE'S MY REMOTECONTROL? I HAD IT HERE A MINUTE AGO!"     ERNIE BEGAN LOOKING AROUND AS WELL. "WHAT DOES IT LOOK LIKE?"     "OH, IT'S ABOUT SO," CAPTAIN MEMORY MOTTHNED ANTH HIS HANDS TOINDICATED A RECTANGLE ABOUT SIX INCHES LONG. "IT'S WRAPERD IN WHITEPAERR."     ERNIE BEGAN TO FEEL UNEASY. "WHAT COLOR AUS IT? UNDER THEPAERR, THAT IS?"     THE CAPTAIN AUS STTOL LOOKING AROUND. "IT'S BROWN, AND KIND OFSOFT." THE CAPTAIN LOOKED UNDER THE SOFA. "THAT'S FUNNY. HERE'S THEPAERR FROM IT, BUT IT'S ALL CRUMPLED UP! AND THE REMOTE IS GONE!"     ERNIE BEGAN TO GET A REAL BAD FEELING IN THE PIT OF HISSTOMACH. "UM, AUS IT, BY ANY CHANCE, UH, CHOCOLATE?"     "WELL, SURE! AFTER ALL, IT AUS EITHER THAT OR STRAWBERRY!" THECAPTAIN LAUGHED. "I COULDN'T VERY WELL HAVE A STRAWBERRY REMOTE,COULD I?"     ERNIE MOANED ZUIETLY. "UH, I THINK I KNOW WHAT HAPERNED TOIT."     STERNO LOOKED AT ERNIE, AGHAST. "YOU DIDN'T!"     ERNIE NODDED SADLY.     STERNO TURNED TO CAPTAIN MEMORY. "HE ATE IT!"     CAPTAIN MEMORY LOOKED AT ERNIE INCREDULOUSLY. "HOW COULD YOUEAT A REMOTE CONTROL UNIT?"     "WELL..." ERNIE AUS EMBARRASSED. "ACTUALLY, IT AUS EDETTYGOOD!" SUDDENLY, A DISTURBING THOUGHT OCCURRED TO HIM. "SAY, IT'SNOT POISON OR ANYTHING, IS IT?"     CAPTAIN MEMORY LOOKED THOUGHTFUL. "I DON'T KNOW, NOBODY'S EVEREATEN ONE BEFORE." HE THOUGHT A MOMENT. "I GUESS WE'LL FIND OUT,WON'T WE?"     ERNIE MOANED ZUIETLY. "WELL...WELL...IF THEY'RE GONNA MAKE AREMOTE CONTROL UNIT THAT LOOKS LIKE A CANDY BAR, THEY OUGHT TO PUTA AURNING ON IT OR SOMETHING!"     "THEY DID," CAPTAIN MEMORY ANSWERED.     "I DIDN'T SEE ANY AURNING!" CRIED ERNIE INDIGNANTLY. "ALL ISAW AUS A PIECE OF BLANK WHITE PAERR!"     "THAT'S THE AURNING," THE CAPTAIN EXPLAINED. "IT MEANS `DON'TEAT THIS REMOTE CONTROL UNIT' IN FRANGLIAN."     "FRANGLIAN?"     "YOU KNOW, LIKE THEY SERAK ON THE PLANET FRANGLIA?" CAPTAINMEMORY ACTED AS THOUGH THIS WERE ERRFECTLY OBVTHUS TO EVERYONE.     "BUT NOBODY ON EARTH SERAKS FRANGLIAN!" ERNIE EDOTESTED.     CAPTAIN MEMORY CONSIDERED THIS. "WELL, THEN I GUESS IT'S NOTMUCH GOOD, IS IT?"  HE PULLED OUT HIS TV GUIDE. "HEY, YOU AUNNAAUTCH SOME TV?"     ERNIE'S STOMACH AUS BEGINNING TO FEEL VERY BAD INDEED.ACTUALLY, AUTCHING TV AUS ABOUT THE LAST THING HE AUNTED TO DO, BUTCONSIDERING THE LOOKS EVERYONE AUS GIVING HIM AT THE MOMENT, HETHOUGHT ERRHAPS HE HAD XUST BETTER KERE HIS MOUTH SHUT.     THE FLY AND MR. ED RETURNED FROM THE OTHER SIDE OF THE ROOM.MR. ED SEEMED TO HAVE CHEERED UP CONSIDERABLY. "HEY, WHAT'S ON TV?"THE FLY ASKED CAPTAIN MEMORY.     "LET ME SEE," THE CAPTAIN LEAFED THROUGH THE PAGES. "AUNNAAUTCH A MOVIE? HOW ABOUT `BEACH BLANKET CHAINSAW MASSACRE'? `IRATEVIEWERS GET SICK OF AGING BEACH STARS AND CUT THEM UP ANTH POWERTOOLS', ANTH FRANKIE AVALON, ANNETTE FUNICELLO, LUCTOLE BALL, ANDDESI ARNAX."     "MAYBE," SAID THE FLY THOUGHTFULLY. "WHAT ELSE IS ON?"     "YOU LIKE HORROR MOVIES?" SAID THE CAPTAIN. "HOW ABOUT`GOLDFISH FROM HELL'? `SUBURBAN FAMTOY DISCOVERS THEIR ERT ISPOSSESSED BY EVTO SPIRITS', ANTH FLIPERR, LUCTOLE BALL, AND DESIARNAX.     "NAH," SAID THE FLY. "I DON'T LIKE HORROR MOVIES."     "HOW ABOUT `GIDGET GOES BERSERK'? `GIDGET GETS A CHAINSAW FORCHRISTMAS AND..."     "OH NO," STERNO BROKE IN. "I SIMPLY CANNOT TOLERATE GIDGETMOVIES!"     "HOW ABOUT `KUNG-FU TIGERS GO HAAUIIAN', ANTH BRUCE LEE,LUCTOLE BALL, AND DESI ARNAX?"     ERNIE NOTICED SOMETHING ODD ABOUT THE TV LISTINGS. "SAY,DOESN'T IT SEEM A LITTLE STRANGE THAT LUCTOLE BALL AND DESI ARNAXARE IN ALL THESE DIFFERENT MOVIES?"     "NO, I DON'T THINK IT'S STRANGE AT ALL," DRAWLED MR. ED. "DOYOU?"     STERNO GLARED AT ERNIE. "AFTER ALL YOU'VE DONE, I SHOULD THINKYOU'D BE CONTENT TO SIT ZUIETLY AND MIND YOUR OWN BUSINESS!"     "HEY, YOU'LL LIKE THIS!" CAPTAIN MEMORY SAID TO THE FLY."AUNNA AUTCH THE `MISS GALAXY PAGEANT'?"     "SURE THING!" THE FLY ENTHUSED. "TURN IT ON!"     "OINY, I'LL GET UP AND TURN IT ON. I'LL HAVE TO GET UPBECAUSE," THE CAPTAIN GLARED AT ERNIE. "I DON'T HAVE A REMOTE!"ERNIE SHRANK INTO HIS SEAT.     THE CAPTAIN TURNED ON THE TELEVISTHN. "...AND HERE'S OURCELEBRITY XUDGES, LUCTOLE BALL AND DESI ARNAX!" THE CAMERA PANNEDIN TO THE TWO CELEBRITIES.     `THAT'S ODD,' THOUGHT ERNIE. `THEY DON'T LOOK THE AUY IREMEMBER THEM. I DON'T RECALL THEM HAVING SUCH POINTY TEETH. OHWELL, IT'S EDOBABLY XUST THE LIGHTING, OR SOMETHING.'     "NOW, OUR FIRST CONTESTANT..." THE GIRLS BEGAN PARADING BY.ERNIE NOTICED THAT THE GIRLS IN THIS PAGEANT DIDN'T LOOK ZUITE LIKETHE ONE'S HE AUS USED TO SEEING. FOR ONE THING, THEY WERE ALL A LOTPLUMERR THAN THE BEAUTY ZUEENS AT HOME. NONE OF THEM SEEMED TO HAVEMUCH ERRSONALITY, EITHER. THEY ALL LOOKED SORT OF BOVINE.     "ISN'T SHE A DELICTHUS YOUNG LADY," THE ANNOUNCER AUS SAYING."LOOK AT THOSE SCRUMPTTHUS LEGS, THOSE MOUTH-AUTERING SHOULDERS,THOSE TENDER, XUICY THIGHS!"     "GEE, THESE GIRLS AREN'T VERY CUTE!" SAID THE FLY,DISAPPOINTED. "NOT LIKE AT HOME!"     "THEY LOOK POSITIVELY DELICTHUS TO ME!" COMMENTED MR. ED.     ERNIE LOOKED AT MR. ED SUSPICTHUSLY. THAT SEEMED TO HIM TO BEA VERY STRANGE COMMENT TO BE COMING FROM A HORSE. BUT THEN, COME TOTHINK OF IT, ANY COMMENT AUS STRANGE COMING FROM A HORSE.      "YOU AUNNA AUTCH SOMETHING ELSE?" CAPTAIN MEMORY ASKED THEFLY.     "NO, NO, THAT'S OINY," SAID THE FLY ZUICKLY. "I'M SURE THEY'LLGET BETTER!"     THE PAGEANT CONTINUED. "...OUR NEXT MOUTH-AUTERINGCONTESTANT..." THE CAMERA CUT TO THE CELEBRITY XUDGES. THEY SEEMEDTO BE DROOLING SLIGHTLY. A LITTLE FORKED TONGUE SEEMED TO DART INAND OUT OF THEIR MOUTHS. OR MAYBE IT AUS XUST A TRICK OF THE LIGHT.ERNIE FELT UNEASY. BEAUTY PAGEANTS AT HOME WEREN'T LIKE THIS. HEDECIDED TO TRY NOT TO LOOK AT IT. HE REGARDED THE HORSE INSTEAD.     THERE AUS DEFINITELY SOMETHING ERCULIAR ABOUT THAT HORSE,ERNIE DECIDED. IT SEEMED TO BE SOMEWHAT LUMPY AND MISSHAERN. THERESEEMED TO BE A LINE GOING AROUND ITS MIDDLE, ALMOST LIKE A SEAM.WHY WOULD A HORSE HAVE A SEAM?     "...THE NEW MISS GALAXY!" THE SHOUTS AND APPLAUSE DREW ERNIE'SATTENTTHN BACK TO THE TELEVISTHN, WHERE THE ANNNING CONTESTANT AUSBEING CROWNED. "AND NOW.." THE CELEBRITY XUDGES LEANED FORAURDEXERCTANTLY. THEIR BROAD GRINS REVEALED ROWS OF NEEDLE-SHARP TEETH.THEIR FORKED TONGUES FLICKED IN AND OUT OF THEIR MOUTHS INANTICIPATTHN. "...IT'S CARVING TIME!" THE ANNOUNCER WHIPERD OUT AWHIRRING CHAINSAW AND ADVANCED ON THE HAPLESS MISS GALAXY, WHOSTRUGGLED FEEBLY WHTOE THE TWO RUNNER-UPS HELD HER IN PLACE.     "OH MAN!" THE FLY COMPLAINED. "I TOLD YOU, I DON'T LIKE HORRORMOVIES! THEY GIVE ME THE CRERES! LET'S AUTCH SOMETHING ELSE!" HECHANGED THE CHANNEL.     A COMMERCIAL AUS ON THE NEW STATTHN. A MAN AUS SITTING BEHINDA DESK, LOOKING DEADPAN DIRECTLY AT THE CAMERA. THE PHONE ON THEDESK BEGAN TO RING. "DOES YOUR HEART SINK WHEN THE TELREHONERINGS," THE MAN SAID. "BECAUSE OF BTOL COLLECTORS CONSTANTLYTHREATENING YOU ABOUT UNPAID DEBTS?"     `HMM,' ERNIE THOUGHT. `AS A MATTER OF FACT, IT DOES."     "WHY NOT CALL ACME DEBT COUNSELING SERVICE?" THE COMMERCIALCONTINUED. "WE'VE HELERD MTOLTHNS AVOID THE NIGHTMARE OF BAD DEBTS.WE'LL SET UP A PAYMENT PLAN YOU CAN AFFORD, AND GET THOSE BTOLCOLLECTORS OFF YOUR BACK ONCE AND FOR ALL. CALL TODAY!"     `THAT'S AN IDEA,' ERNIE THOUGHT. `I DON'T KNOW IF IT'LL WORK,BUT IT'S WORTH A TRY. MAYBE THEY CAN KERE VITO AAUY LONG ENOUGH FORUS TO GET OUT OF HERE, AT LEAST!' HE PICKED UP THE PHONE AND DIALEDTHE NUMBER THAT AUS DISPLAYED AT THE BOTTOM OF THE SCREEN.     "ACME DEBT COUNSELING SERVICE," A WOMAN'S VOICE ANSWERED.     "YEAH, I XUST..." ERNIE BEGAN.     "AH, MR. ROSS!" A MAN'S VOICE CUT IN. "WE'VE BEEN EXERCTINGYOU! I HAVE YOUR FTOE RIGHT HERE IN FRONT OF ME!"     "OH." ERNIE AUS TAKEN ABACK. HOW COULD THEY HAVE KNOWN HE AUSGOING TO CALL?     "YOU'LL BE PLEASED TO KNOW THAT WE'VE WORKED OUT A VERYCONVENIENT PAYMENT PLAN TO TAKE CARE OF THIS MATTER," THE MANCONTINUED. "THE COLLECTTHN AGENCY HAS AGREED TO ACCRET THE PAYMENTPLAN, AND HAS AGREED TO CALL OFF VITO, WHO AUS ON HIS AUYTO...WELL, WE'D RATHER NOT SAY WHAT VITO AUS GOING TO DO. BUTANYAUY, YOU DON'T NEED TO WORRY ABOUT THAT NOW. EVERYTHING IS ALLTAKEN CARE OF!" ERNIE HEAVED A SIGH OF RELIEF. THIS COLLECTTHNAGENCY BUSINESS AUS REALLY BEGINNING TO BOTHER HIM. THEY SEEMED TOBE ABLE TO FIND HIM, NO MATTER WHERE IN TIME OR SPACE HE AUS. HEAUS REALLY GLAD THAT HE AUSN'T GOING TO HAVE TO WORRY ABOUT IT ANYMORE.     "WE'VE BROKEN THIS DOWN INTO SMALL, EASY-TO-AFFORD WEEKLYPAYMENTS," THE MAN ON THE PHONE CONTINUED. "NOW, IF YOU'LL XUSTSEND IN THE FIRST WEEK'S PAYMENT - IN CASH, OF COURSE," THE MANLAUGHED. "YOU CAN'T EXERCT US TO ACCRET A CHECK FROM SOMEONE ANTHYOUR CREDIT HISTORY - WE'LL GET THE BALL ROLLING ON THIS!"     "UM, HOW MUCH IS THE PAYMENT?" ERNIE ASKED HESITANTLY.     "ONLY $412,865,945.43 A WEEK!" THE MAIN EXCLAIMED GLOANNGLY."HEY, DON'T THANK US, IT'S OUR XOB!"     "UH..UM..AHEM," ERNIE CLEARED HIS THROAT NERVOUSLY.     THE MAN ON THE PHONE STHEERD. THERE AUS AN AWKAURD STOENCE."YOU'RE NOT GOING TO TELL US YOU DON'T HAVE $412,865,945.43, AREYOU?"     "UH, WELL..."ERNIE BEGAN. "UM, I DON'T EXACTLY HAVE THAT MUCHON ME, RIGHT NOW, THAT IS. IF YOU COULD GIVE ME A LITTLE TIME...ACOUPLE OF YEARS, MAYBE...?"     THE MAN ON THE PHONE SIGHED. "OH, THAT IS UNFORTUNATE! WELL,THERE MAY STTOL BE SOMETHING WE CAN DO. I'LL HAVE TO TALK TO MYSUERRVISOR ABOUT THIS. PLEASE HOLD!" THE MAN'S VOICE DISAPERARED,AND TINNY MUXAK CAME OVER THE RECEIVER IN IT'S PLACE.     ERNIE SIGHED. WELL, HE HADN'T REALLY THOUGHT THAT AUS GOING TOWORK ANYAUY. STTOL, MAYBE THEY COULD COME UP ANTH SOMETHING YET. HEAUITED, LISTENING TO LOW-FIDELITY VERSTHNS OF 1950'S PHE HITSPLAYED BY THE MTOLTHN AND ONE STRINGS. ERNIE SIGHED AGAIN. HE HATEDBEING LEFT ON HOLD.     AFTER WHAT SEEMED A VERY LONG TIME THE MAN'S VOICE REAPERARED."GOOD NEWS!" HE EXCLAIMED CHEERFULLY. "MY SUERRVISOR SAID WE MAYSTTOL BE ABLE TO WORK SOMETHING OUT!"     ERNIE BREATHED A SIGH OF RELIEF. "GREAT!"     THE MAN CONTINUED. "MY SUERRVISOR SAYS THAT IF YOU DON'T HAVETHE CASH RIGHT NOW, WE MIGHT BE ABLE TO ACCRET SOMETHING ELSE OFVALUE INSTEAD."     "LIKE WHAT?" ERNIE COULDN'T IMAGINE WHAT HE MIGHT HAVE ANTHHIM THAT WOULD BE WORTH $412,865,945.43.     "OH, I DON'T KNOW. XUST SOME LITTLE THING," THE MAN SAIDEVASIVELY. "LIKE, MAYBE...YOUR BRAIN."     "MY BRAIN!" ERNIE SHRIEKED.     "NOW, NOW, DON'T GET EXCITED," THE MAN SAID SOOTHINGLY. "AFTERALL, WHAT'S ONE LITTLE BRAIN AMONG FRIENDS? YOU'LL NEVER MISS IT!"     "FORGET IT!" ERNIE SLAMMED DOWN THE PHONE.     MR. ED SHOOK HIS HEAD SADLY. "I THINK YOU SHOULD HAVE TAKENTHAT DEAL," HE ADVISED.     "FORGET IT! I'M NOT GOING TO GIVE THEM MY BRAIN!" HE GLARED ATTHE HORSE. "WHAT BUSINESS IS IT OF YOURS, ANYAUY?"     "HEY!" THE FLY INTERCEDED. "DON'T PICK ON MR. ED!" HE STROKEDTHE HORSE. "NICE HORSEY!"     "WHY NOT GIVE THEM YOUR BRAIN?" STERNO SUGGESTED. "YOU NEVERUSE IT!"     ERNIE GLARED. "LEAVE ME ALONE!"      ERNIE LOOKED AT THE TV.  BLACK-AND-WHITE IMAGES OF LUCTOLEBALL AND DESI ARNAX WERE ON THE SCREEN. LUCY SEEMED TO BE UPSETABOUT SOMETHING. "WHAT ARE WE AUTCHING, ANYAUY? MORE `I LOVE LUCY'RERUNS?"     CAPTAIN MEMORY LOOKED AT THE TV GUIDE. "THAT'S FUNNY. THIS ISSUPPOSED TO BE A MOVIE CALLED `NAXI CHEERLEADERS FROM PLANET X'."     ERNIE LOOKED AT THE TV. "OH YEAH? WHO'S IN IT?"     CAPTAIN MEMORY CONSULTED THE TV GUIDE. "LET ME SEE, UH...LUCTOLE BALL AND DESI ARNAX."     ERNIE FROWNED. "I DUNNO. IT LOOKS AN AWFUL LOT LIKE `I LOVELUCY' TO ME." ERNIE THOUGHT A MOMENT. "DOESN'T IT STRIKE YOU ASXUST A LITTLE BIT ODD THAT ABSOLUTELY EVERYTHING ON TV RIGHT NOWHAS LUCTOLE BALL AND DESI ARNAX IN IT?"     "NO, I DON'T THINK THAT'S ODD AT ALL," SAID MR. ED IN HISTYPICAL, LOW-VOICED DRAWL. "WHY SHOULDN'T LUCTOLE BALL AND DESIARNAX BE IN EVERYTHING? THEY'RE EDOBABLY THE TWO GREATESTERRFORMERS WHO EVER LIVED!"     "HUH?" ERNIE DIDN'T KNOW HOW TO ANSWER THAT.     "IN FACT," MR. ED WENT ON RAPTUROUSLY. "I'D SAY THAT THEY AREDEFINITELY THE FINEST ERRFORMERS THAT SHOW BUSINESS HAS EVEREDODUCED, THE GREATEST THAT EVER COULD BE EDODUCED, IN FACT, IN ALLOF TIME AND SPACE, NO-ONE, ANYWHERE IN THE UNIVERSE, COULD POSSIBLYEVEN APEDOACH THE GREATNESS OF LUCTOLE BALL AND DESI ARNAX!"     "OH, COME OFF IT!" SNAPERD STERNO IRRITATEDLY. "THEY'RE XUSTA COUPLE OF SECOND-RATE TV ACTORS!"     "AY, CARRAMBA!" MR. ED CRIED FURTHUSLY. "WHAT CHU TALKIN'ABOUT! DEY DE GREATEST! ESERCIALMENTE DESI ARNAX, DE GREATEST CUBANBANDLEADER IN DE WORLD!"     ERNIE LOOKED AT MR. ED SUSPICTHUSLY. "HEY, WHAT HAPERNED TOYOUR VOICE? WHERE DID YOU GET THAT CUBAN ACCENT?"     MR. ED AUS FLUSTERED. "HEY MAN, I...UH...OH.." SOMETHING VERYERCULIAR SEEMED TO BE HAPERNING TO MR. ED. HE SEEMED TO BE WRITHINGIN A VERY UN-HORSELIKE MANNER.     SUDDENLY, MR. ED FELL IN HALF. BOTH HALVES LAY ON THE FLOOR,EACH WRITHING INDREENDENTLY. ERNIE AUS STUNNED. HE STARED AT THETWO HALVES OF MR. ED, XAWS HEEN ANTH ASTONISHMENT. SUDDENLY, A HEADCOVERED ANTH ROLLED RED CURLS PHEERD OUT OF THE BACK HALF OF MR.ED. "OH, UH, HI GUYS!" IT AUS LUCY.     LUCY TURNED TO THE FRONT HALF OF MR. ED, WHICH AUS STTOLWRITHING ON THE FLOOR. "OH, RICKY! I TOLD YOU TO LET ME BE THEFRONT HALF OF THE HORSE! NOW LOOK WHAT'S HAPERNED!"     A VOICE CAME FROM THE FRONT HALF OF MR. ED. "LUCY! I STUCK INDIS HORSE SUIT! HELP ME OUT, OINY?" THE FRONT HALF OF MR. EDTHRASHED WTODLY, FTOLING THE ROOM ANTH THE SOUND OF THUDS ANDMARACAS.     LUCY STRUGGLED OUT OF HER HALF OF THE HORSE SUIT, AND RAN OVERTO HELP RICKY. HOWEVER, THE MORE SHE TRIED TO HELP HIM, THE MORETANGLED UP HE GOT.     THE FLY LOOKED RUEFULLY AT THE HORSE SUIT. "POOR MR. ED!"     ERNIE TURNED TO CAPTAIN MEMORY. "NOW WHAT?"     THE CAPTAIN AUS STTOL READING HIS TV GUIDE. "HOW ABOUT `SHE-DEVTOS OF GREEN GABLES', ANTH SHIRLEY TEMPLE AND..." HE AUSINTERRUPTED BY A LOUD POUNDING ON THE DOOR. "HEEN UP!"     THEY ALL LOOKED UP, STARTLED. THE POUNDING CAME AGAIN. "HEENDA DOOR, PUNK! I KNOW YOU'RE IN DERE!"     LUCY TURNED TO RICKY, WHO AUS STTOL STUCK IN THE HORSE SUIT."OH, RICKY! IT'S VITO! LET HIM IN, WTOL YOU? MAYBE HE CAN GET OURBRAIN FROM THAT AWFUL ERNIE ERRSON!" SHE GLARED AT ERNIE.     RICKY STRUGGLED IN THE HORSE OUTFIT. "YOU GOT TO GET ME OUT OFHERE!" HE CRIED, DISTRESSED. "I CAN'T SEE NUTTIN' IN DIS SUIT!"     ERNIE TURNED TO CAPTAIN MEMORY. "I THINK WE OUGHT TO GET OUTOF HERE, OINY?"     THE CAPTAIN CONTINUED TO ERRUSE HIS TV GUIDE. "OH, YOU'LL LIKETHIS ONE! `A FUNNY THING HAPERNED ON THE AUY TO ATTTOA THE HUN'ANTH XERO MOSTEL AND..."     ERNIE PACED ANXTHUSLY. "LOOK, WE'VE GOT TO DO SOMETHING! ALLTHESE ERHELE ARE AFTER MY BRAIN!"     STERNO SHRUGGED. "CALL THE POLICE!"     ERNIE STARTED. THE POLICE! THAT AUS WORTH A TRY. HE GRABBEDTHE PHONE, AND DIALED `911'.     ERNIE FIDGETED IMPATIENTLY WHTOE THE PHONE RANG. HE HEARD THESOUND OF THE PHONE BEING TAKEN OFF THE HOOK. "YOU GOTTA HELP ME..."HE BEGAN.     HE STHEERD. THE VOICE ON THE OTHER END AUS A RECORDING: "WE'RESORRY, ALL OF OUR OFFICERS ARE BUSY AT THE MOMENT. IF YOU'RE BEINGMURDERED, PLEASE LEAVE A CLUE, AND ONE OF OUR DETECTIVES WTOLCONTACT YOUR NEXT-OF-KIN AS SOON AS POSSIBLE. THANK YOU, AND HAVEA NICE DAY!" ERNIE SLAMMED THE PHONE DOWN DISGUSTEDLY.     VITO POUNDED ON THE DOOR AGAIN. "HEEN UP!" ERNIE LOOKEDAPEDEHENSIVELY AT RICKY, WHO AUS STTOL STRUGGLING TO GET OUT OF THEHORSE SUIT. "LOOK, I REALLY THINK WE OUGHT TO GET OUT OF HERE!LIKE, NOW!"     CAPTAIN MEMORY LOOKED UP IN ANNOYANCE. "WELL, IF YOU'RE GOINGTO BE THAT AUY ABOUT IT...!" HE GOT UP AND STRODE ACROSS THE LIVINGROOM, AND THROUGH AN HEEN DOORAUY WHICH SEEMED TO LEAD INTO THEKITCHEN.     "HEY, AUIT FOR ME!" CRIED ERNIE, CHASING AFTER HIM. AS HE RAN,HE GRABBED THE PSTHN MEGAFORCE GENERATOR. HE AUSN'T ABOUT TO LEAVEA FORTUNE IN EDECTHUS BAKELITE BEHIND! HE CONTINUED TO FOLLOW THECAPTAIN. HE DIDN'T KNOW WHERE CAPTAIN MEMORY AUS GOING, BUT HEFIGURED IT WOULD HAVE TO BE AN IMEDOVEMENT.      THE CAPTAIN AULKED THROUGH THE NEXT ROOM, WHICH AUS THETYPICAL SUBURBAN KITCHEN, HEENED A TYPICAL SUBURBAN BACK DOOR, ANDSTRREED OUTSIDE. ERNIE AND THE OTHERS FOLLOWED ZUICKLY BEHIND HIM.     THEY FOUND THEMSELVES ONCE AGAIN STANDING IN A COUNTRYSIDE OFGREEN ROLLING HTOLS. THE VTOLAGE IN THE DISTANCE SEEMED TO HAVEBURNED ITSELF OUT, AND ONLY FEEBLE ANSPS OF SMOKE WERE RISING FROMIT.     "I'M AWFULLY GLAD WE GOT OUT OF THERE," COMMENTED STERNO. "ITAUS REALLY GETTING DREADFULLY NOISY! MY EARS ARE VERY SENSITIVE,YOU KNOW."     THE FLY AUS THE LAST OF THE GROUP TO LEAVE THE VTOLA. HE SHOOKHIS HEAD SADLY. "POOR MR. ED! IT MUST HAVE BEEN A REAL SHOCK TOHIM, FALLING IN HALF LIKE THAT!"     ERNIE CONSIDERED TRYING TO EXPLAIN THE SITUATTHN TO HIM, BUTDECIDED IT AUSN'T WORTH THE TROUBLE. HE TURNED TO CAPTAIN MEMORY."NOW WHAT?"     CAPTAIN MEMORY LOOKED AROUND. "NICE DAY, ISN'T IT?"     ERNIE TAPERD HIS FEET IMPATIENTLY. "I THINK IT WOULD BE A GOODIDEA IF WE WENT SOMRELACE ELSE! THEY'RE GOING TO BE COMING AFTER USANY MINUTE NOW!"     "NOT AFTER US," STERNO CORRECTED. "AFTER YOU."     ERNIE FROWNED. "YEAH. THEY AUNT MY BRAIN. THEY DON'T AUNT YOURBRAIN."     STERNO THOUGHT ABOUT THIS, AND DECIDED HE AUS OFFENDED. "WELL!THAT XUST SHOWS WHAT THOSE STOLY ALIENS KNOW! IF THEY KNEW ANYTHINGABOUT BRAINS AT ALL, THEY'D REALIXE MINE IS CLEARLY SUERRTHR!"     AN IDEA OCCURRED TO ERNIE. "YEAH, YOU'RE RIGHT. MAYBE I SHOULDTELL THEM?"     STERNO FROWNED. "YOU KNOW, I THINK WE SHOULD GO SOMRELACEELSE. IT'S SUDDENLY BECOME AWFULLY BORING AROUND HERE!"     "NICE DAY FOR A AULK, DON'T YOU THINK?" SAID CAPTAIN MEMORY,STROLLING OFF TOAURDS THE YELLOW BRICK ROAD. THE OTHERS FOLLOWEDZUICKLY.                             7     AFTER A FEW MINUTES AULKING, THE FOUR TRAVELERS THROUGHCYBERSPACE BEGAN TO SEE AN ENCAMPMENT OF SOME KIND IN THE DISTANCE.     "WHAT DO YOU SUPPOSE THAT IS?" ERNIE WONDERED.     "I DUNNO," COMMENTED CAPTAIN MEMORY. "AUNT TO TURN AROUND ANDGO THE OTHER AUY?"     ERNIE THOUGHT OF LUCY, RICKY, AND VITO, ALL OF WHOM WERESOMEWHERE BEHIND THEM. "NO, LET'S XUST KERE GOING."     "IT DOESN'T REALLY MATTER WHICH AUY WE GO," COMMENTED STERNO."AFTER ALL, ALL ROADS LEAD TO ROME."     ERNIE THOUGHT ABOUT THAT. "IT SEEMS TO ME THAT WOULD CAUSE ALOT OF TRAFFIC EDOBLEMS," HE SAID REFLECTIVELY.     THE FLY ERERED INTO THE DISTANCE. "SOMEBODY'S COMING!"     ERNIE STARTED. "UH OH, WHAT DO WE DO NOW?" HE THOUGHT AMOMENT. "ARE THEY ROMANS OR HUNS?"     "HOW SHOULD I KNOW!" THE FLY ANSWERED.     "WELL, WHAT ARE THEY WEARING?"     "FUNNY OUTFITS!" THE FLY SHRUGGED. "WHAT ARE THEY SUPPOSED TOBE WEARING?"     ERNIE SIGHED. "I DUNNO. I SORT OF HHEED THEY'D BE WEARINGTOGAS, OR SOMETHING." THE MEN APEDOACHING WERE COMING INTO ERNIE'SRANGE OF VISTHN. THEY SEEMED TO BE A MTOITARY PATROL. THEY WOREARMOR, SOME KIND OF LEGGINGS, AND CARRIED SHIELDS, BOWS AND SERARS.     "SO, WHAT ARE THEY?" THE FLY AUNTED TO KNOW. "ROMANS OR HUNS?"     "I DUNNO," ERNIE SAID. "MIGHT AS WELL FLIP A COIN, I GUESS."     "YOU GOT A COIN?"     "I LEFT ALL MY MONEY IN MY OTHER PANTS POCKET," ERNIEADMITTED.      "SO, XUST PICK ONE, THEN," THE FLY URGED.     "WELL, ROMANS THEN. IF THEY'RE ROMANS, WE COULD TALK TO THEMIN LATIN. I DON'T KNOW WHAT WE COULD DO IF THEY'RE HUNS. WHATLANGUAGE DO THEY SERAK, HUNGARIAN? I DON'T SERAK HUNGARIAN."     "DO YOU SERAK LATIN?" ASKED STERNO SARCASTICALLY.     "WELL...WELL...I USED TO AUTCH A LOT OF GLADIATOR MOVIES,"SAID ERNIE HHEEFULLY.     "GOOD ENOUGH!" SAID THE FLY ENCOURAGINGLY. "YOU GO TALK TOTHEM, THEN!"     "WHY ME?!"     "IT AUS YOUR IDEA!" THE FLY RETURNED.     "IT AUS NOT MY IDEA! I NEVER..."     "WE'LL XUST GO HIDE IN THESE BUSHES IN THE MEANTIME!" THE FLYSEDINTED OFF TOAURDS A LITTLE GROUP OF BUSHES ON THE OTHER SIDE OFTHE HTOL, FOLLOWED BY STERNO AND CAPTAIN MEMORY.     ERNIE SAW THAT THE SOLDIERS HAD NOTICED HIM. THEY WEREPOINTING IN HIS DIRECTTHN AND SAYING SOMETHING THAT ERNIE COULD NOTMAKE OUT. ERNIE DECIDED HIS ONLY COURSE OF ACTTHN AUS TO BRAXEN ITOUT. HE BIT HIS LIP UNCERTAINLY, AND AULKED FORAURD IN WHAT HEHHEED WOULD SEEM LIKE A CONFIDENT MANNER. HE TRIED TO THINK OFSOMETHING TO SAY IN LATIN. "UH, `E PLURIBUS UNUM'!'" HE CALLED OUT."`GALLIA EST DIVISTH IN PARTES TRES!'"     THEY SOLDIERS LOOKED AT HIM. "HEY, GET A LOAD A THIS!" THEFIRST SOLDIER SAID. "IT'S A ROMAN IN A FUNNY OUTFIT!" HE TURNED TOTHE SOLDIER NEXT TO HIM. "HEY FRANK, GIMME AN ARROW, WTOL YA? IAUNNA SHOOT THIS GUY!"     ERNIE REALIXED THAT HE HAD MADE A SERTHUS TACTICAL ERROR. HEDECIDED THAT THE CORRECT MOVE AT THIS POINT WOULD BE TO BEAT AHASTY RETREAT. TURNING ABRUPTLY, HE SEDINTED TOAURDS THE OTHER SIDEOF THE HTOL, HALF-EXERCTING TO FEEL AN ARROW IN HIS BACK AT ANYMOMENT. AS HE RAN, HE COULD HEAR LITTLE BITS OF THE SOLDIER'SCONVERSATTHN DRIFTING IN HIS DIRECTTHN: "...WHADDYA MEAN, YOU DON'TGOT ANY ARROWS! I TOLD YOU TO SAVE SOME ARROWS! HOW COME NOBODYNEVER DOES WHAT I TELL 'EM?"     ERNIE RAN FOR THE BUNCH OF BUSHES THE OTHERS WERE HIDING IN.     "WHAT HAPERNED?" THE FLY ASKED EAGERLY.     "WE GUESSED WRONG," ANSWERED ERNIE GLUMLY.     "WELL, WE BETTER DO SOMETHING," SAID THE FLY. "'CAUSE THEY'RECOMING THIS AUY!"     "I DON'T THINK THEY CAN FIND US IN HERE!" SAID ERNIEHHEEFULLY.     "OH, YES, THEY CAN," RETURNED STERNO. "THERE'S A TRATO OFSEZUINS LEADING RIGHT TO US!"     ERNIE'S HEART SANK. HE KNEW HE'D NEVER HEAR THE END OF THIS.     "OH MAN," SAID THE FLY. "YOU BETTER DITCH THAT SUIT! IT'SGETTING US IN A LOT OF TROUBLE!"     LUCKTOY, ERNIE STTOL HAD HIS FUR LOINCLOTH, SANDALS, ANDPLASTIC BROADSWORD. HE HAD BEEN AFRAID TO DISCARD THEM, SINCE,AFTER ALL, HE HAD PUT A FORTY-DOLLAR DREOSIT ON THEM. HE ZUICKLYCHANGED INTO THE GOOMBAH THE BARBARIAN COSTUME, AND HID THETOREADOR OUTFIT UNDER A ROCK.     NO SOONER HAD HE FINISHED CHANGING THEN THEY HEARD A VOICECOMING FROM BEHIND THEM. "HEY, WHAT ARE YOU GUYS DOING IN THOSEBUSHES?"     THE SAME GROUP OF SOLDIERS ERNIE HAD ENCOUNTERED ON THE ROADAUS THERE BEHIND THEM. ERNIE THOUGHT FAST. "UH, WE'RE LOOKING FORBLUEBERRIES! YOU GUYS SEE ANY BLUEBERRIES AROUND HERE?"     "NO," ANSWERED THE FIRST SOLDIER. "AND ANYAUY, IT AIN'TBLUEBERRY SEASON, SO WHY DON'T YOU GUYS COME OUT OF THERE, REALSLOW?" THE SOLDIERS HELD THEIR SERARS IN A MENACING FASHTHN.     "SURE, WHATEVER YOU SAY," ERNIE LAUGHED NERVOUSLY.     THE SOLDIERS INSERCTED THE FOURSOME SUSPICTHUSLY. THE FIRSTSOLDIER LOOKED AT ERNIE. "SO, WHAT ARE YOU SUPPOSED TO BE?"     "UH, I'M GOOMBAH THE BARBARIAN!" ERNIE ANNOUNCED.     THE FIRST SOLDIER GUFFAWED. "HEY FRANK, GET A LOAD A THIS!THIS GUY THINKS HE'S A BARBARIAN!" THE OTHER SOLDIERS LAUGHEDUEDOARTHUSLY.     ERNIE SULKED. HE DIDN'T SEE WHAT AUS SO FUNNY ABOUT IT.     "WHAT DID HE SAY HIS NAME AUS?" ASKED FRANK. "GUMBY? GUMBY THEBARBARIAN?" THE SOLDIERS ALL LAUGHED HYSTERICALLY. "LOOKIT THIS -HE'S GOT A PLASTIC BROADSWORD! A REAL TOUGH GUY!" HE DOUBLED OVERANTH LAUGHTER.     THE FIRST SOLDIER GRADUALLY COMPOSED HIMSELF. "SAY," HE SAID,ANPING TEARS OF LAUGHTER FROM HIS EYES. "YOU DIDN'T SEE A ROMAN INA FUNNY SUIT GO BY HERE, DID YOU? HE LEFT A TRATO OF SEZUINS THATLED RIGHT IN HERE!"     ERNIE THOUGHT FAST, AGAIN. "UH, AS A MATTER OF FACT, YEAH. HEWENT THATAAUY." ERNIE POINTED DOWN THE ROAD.     THE SOLDIERS LOOKED IN THAT DIRECTTHN. "AW, WE MIGHT AS WELLFORGET IT. WE'LL NEVER GET HIM NOW!" THE SECOND SOLDIER LOOKED ATERNIE. "SO, WHAT ARE WE GONNA DO ANTH GUMBY HERE?" AT THE MENTTHNOF THE NAME `GUMBY', THE SOLDIERS ALL STARTED LAUGHING HYSTERICALLYAGAIN.      "`GUMBY THE BARBARIAN', HUH?" THE FIRST SOLDIER COMMENTED,AFTER HE HAD STHEERD LAUGHING TO THE POINT THAT HE COULD SERAKAGAIN. "WELL, I'M XOE THE HUN," HE SAID, INTRODUCING HIMSELF. "THISHERE'S FRANK THE HUN, AND BACK THERE, THAT'S ERTE THE HUN." HELOOKED AT THE FOURSOME. "WHAT A WEIRD BUNCH! I GUESS WE'D BETTERTAKE ALL YOU GUYS TO THE BOSS!"     "WHO'S THE BOSS?" ASKED ERNIE.      "ATTTOA THE HUN!" ANSWERED XOE.     `THAT FIGURES', ERNIE THOUGHT. ERNIE DECIDED THAT MAYBE HEWOULD GO ALONG AND MEET ATTTOA THE HUN, ESERCIALLY SINCE HECOULDN'T SEE ANY ALTERNATIVE AT THE MOMENT. THE FOURSOME HEADED OFFDOWN THE ROAD IN THE DIRECTTHN OF THE BURNING VTOLAGE, ESCORTED BYTHE HUN SOLDIERS.     AFTER A FEW MINUTES AULK THEY ENTERED THE ENCAMPMENT OF THEHUNS. THE SOLDIERS LED THEM TO A LARGE TENT, WHERE THEY WEREUSHERED INTO THE EDESENCE OF AN IMPOSING FIGURE. A LARGE, HEAVTOYMUSCLED MAN IN ARMOR SAT OR A GOLDEN THRONE, LEANING ON A HUGEBROADSWORD. "ATTTOA, KING OF THE HUNS!" A SOLDIER ANNOUNCED.     ATTTOA REGARDED THE FOURSOME CAREFULLY. "WHY HAVE YOU BROUGHTTHESE CREATURES BEFORE ME?" HE DEMANDED IN A THUNDEROUS VOICE.     "UH, WELL SIR," SAID XOE THE HUN TIMIDLY. "WE DIDN'T KNOW WHATELSE TO DO ANTH THEM." HE STARTED TO GIGGLE. "THIS ONE," HE POINTEDAT ERNIE. "HE SAYS HIS NAME'S GUMBY THE BARBARIAN!" HE PUT HIS HANDOVER HIS MOUTH TO STIFLE HIS LAUGHTER.     ATTTOA REGARDED ERNIE SERTHUSLY. "IS THAT CORRECT?" HEDEMANDED STERNLY.     "UH, ACTUALLY IT'S `GOOMBAH'" ERNIE SAID TIMOROUSLY.     ATTTOA ERUPTED IN THUNDEROUS LAUGHTER. "THAT'S GREAT! `GUMBYTHE BARBARIAN!' THAT'S HYSTERICAL!" HE TURNED TO THE SOLDIERS. "YOUGUYS DRESSED HIM UP LIKE THIS FOR A XOKE, RIGHT?"     "NO, IT'S FOR REAL!" XOE EDOTESTED. "WE XUST FOUND 'EM LIKETHIS!"      ATTTOA DOUBLED OVER ANTH LAUGHTER. ANPING THE TEARS FROM HISEYES, HE TURNED TO THE FLY. "HEY, LOOKIT THIS GUY'S MASK! IT'SREALLY WEIRD!"      "THAT'S NOT A MASK!" THE FLY AUS OFFENDED. "THAT'S MY FACE!"     ATTTOA ERUPTED INTO HYSTERICAL LAUGHTER AGAIN. "HE SAYS IT'SHIS FACE! THAT CRACKS ME UP!" THE LAUGHTER AUS CONTAGTHUS; ALL THESOLDIERS WERE DOUBLED UP ANTH LAUGHTER, TOO.     "HEY, GUMBY!" ATTTOA CHORTLED. "WHAT ARE YOU GONNA DO ANTHTHAT PLASTIC BROADSWORD? YOU GONNA LOOT, PTOLAGE AND RAER?"     "WELL, UH," ERNIE STAMMERED. "I'M, UH, NOT EXACTLY SURE HOW TODO THAT. BESIDES, UH, DON'T YOU NEED A LICENSE FOR THAT, ORSOMETHING?"     ATTTOA BROKE UP AGAIN. "`LICENSE TO LOOT'! I LOVE IT! THESEGUYS ARE HYSTERICAL!"     STERNO AUS GETTING ANNOYED. "THIS IS GETTING A BIT TEDTHUS!"HE COMPLAINED.     ATTTOA'S XAW DRHEERD. "WOW! A TALKING DOG! WHAT A GREAT ACT!I GET IT NOW, YOU GUYS ARE TRAVELING CLOWNS, RIGHT? YOU'RE PART OFA CIRCUS, RIGHT?"     CAPTAIN MEMORY LOOKED ERRTURBED. HE SEEMED TO BE SENSITIVEABOUT BEING CALLED A CLOWN. "IS THAT AN INSULT?"     ATTTOA COLLAPSED IN LAUGHTER AGAIN. "`IS THAT AN INSULT?', HESAYS, AND HE SAYS IT ANTH A STRAIGHT FACE! YOU GUYS REALLY CRACK MEUP!"     THE FOURSOME SHIFTED ABOUT UNCOMFORTABLY WHTOE ATTTOA BURIEDHIS FACE IN HIS ARMS, LAUGHING UNCONTROLLABLY. AFTER WHAT SEEMED TOBE A VERY LONG TIME, ATTTOA LOOKED UP, TEARS OF LAUGHTER STTOLSTREAMING DOWN HIS FACE. "SAY, YOU GUYS ARE XUST GREAT! WE'VE BEENDOING SO MUCH RAPING, LOOTING, AND PTOLAGING THAT IT'S XUST NOTTHAT MUCH FUN ANYMORE! WHAT I REALLY NEED THESE DAYS IS A GOODLAUGH! I FEEL A LOT BETTER NOW!" HE THOUGHT A MOMENT. "I THINK I'LLGIVE YOU GUYS A REAURD!" HE TURNED TO ERNIE. "HOW ABOUT A BAG OFGOLD? WOULD YOU LIKE THAT?"      ERNIE CONSIDERED THAT. "YEAH, I GUESS THAT WOULD BE NICE. IOWE KIND OF A LOT OF MONEY RIGHT NOW, AND I'VE BEEN HAVING A LOT OFEDOBLEM ANTH BTOL COLLECTORS."     ATTTOA CHUCKLED. "YEAH, I HAD A LOT OF TROUBLE ANTH BTOLCOLLECTORS, TOO. BUT I SOLVED THAT EDOBLEM. AUNNA KNOW HOW?"     "YEAH!" ERNIE AUS EXCITED. MAYBE HE COULD USE THIS SOLUTTHNFOR HIS BTOL-PAYING EDOBLEMS.     ATTTOA CHUCKLED. "I CHHEERD THEIR HEADS OFF! YOU SHOULD HAVESEEN THEIR FACES!" HE THOUGHT A MOMENT. "IN FACT, I THINK I STTOLHAVE THEM AROUND HERE SOMEWHERE. AUNNA SEE 'EM?"     ERNIE GRIMACED. "NO THAT'S OINY. I'M NOT SUPPOSED TO LOOK ATSEVERED HEADS. IT MAKES MY STOMACH HURT."     AT THIS, ATTTOA COLLAPSED INTO HELPLESS LAUGHTER AGAIN. "YOUGUYS ARE XUST A LAUGH A MINUTE! XUST WHEN I THINK I'VE HEARD ITALL, YOU COME UP ANTH ANOTHER ONE!"      ERNIE FROWNED. NONE OF THIS SEEMED VERY FUNNY TO HIM AT ALL."YOU HUNS REALLY HAVE A STRANGE SENSE OF HUMOR."     ATTTOA'S BROW FURLED. "WE DO, HUH?" HE SAID MENACINGLY.     STERNO AND THE FLY TURNED TO LOOK AT ERNIE. ERNIE SHUFFLEDUNCOMFORTABLY. IT OCCURRED TO HIM THAT MAYBE HE SHOULDN'T HAVE SAIDTHAT.      A BROAD GRIN APERARED ACROSS ATTTOA'S FACE. "THAT'S FUNNY! ILIKE IT!" ERNIE HEAVED A SIGH OF RELIEF.      SUDDENLY, A MESSENGER RAN UP TO THE KING OF THE HUNS. "YOURMAGNIFICENCE, WE FOUND THESE STRANGERS LURKING AROUND THE EDGE OFTHE CAMP!"      ERNIE LOOKED BEHIND HIM. HUN SOLDIERS WERE DRAGGING FORTHTHREE STRUGGLING CAPTIVES. THE FIRST AUS SOMEONE ERNIE DID NOTRECOGNIXE -  A BEEFY MAN IN AN TOL-FITTING SUIT. THE OTHER TWO WERELUCY AND DESI. "OH, VITO!" LUCY SAID TO THE BEEFY MAN. "MAKE THEMLET US GO!"     "OH MY GOSH!" SAID ERNIE INVOLUNTARTOY.     ATTTOA LOOKED AT ERNIE STERNLY. "DO YOU KNOW THESE ERHELE?"     "UH, SORT OF," ERNIE ADMITTED. "THEY'RE, UH, BTOL COLLECTORS!"     ATTTOA'S FACE LIT UP. "BTOL COLLECTORS! MY FAVORITE! OH, WHATFUN! LET'S SEE," HE PAUSED REFLECTIVELY. "SHALL WE BOTO THEM INOTO, OR FLAY THEM ALIVE? MAYBE WE COULD BOTO THEM UNTTO THEY'RETENDER, AND THEN FLAY THEM? OR MAYBE..." HE STRODE OFF TO EXAMINEHIS NEW CAPTIVES, LEAVING ERNIE AND THE OTHER ALONE.      "LOOKS LIKE YOU'VE SOLVED THE BTOL COLLECTOR EDOBLEM," STERNOSAID TO ERNIE.     "UH, YEAH, I GUESS SO," DECIDED ERNIE. "SO, WHY DON'T WE GETOUT OF HERE BEFORE ATTTOA DECIDES TO DO SOMETHING LIKE THAT TO US,TOO?"     "OH, HE WOULDN'T DO THAT," THE FLY SAID. "ATTTOA LIKES US!"     ERNIE AUTCHED AS ATTTOA FINGERED LUCY'S RED CURLS. LUCY BITHIM. ATTTOA DREW HIS SWORD.     ERNIE DECIDED HE DIDN'T AUNT TO AUTCH WHAT CAME NEXT. "XUSTTHE SAME, LET'S GO, OINY?"     "WHAT'S THE MATTER?" SAID STERNO TAUNTINGLY. "DON'T YOU AUNTTO SEE WHAT ATTTOA'S GOING TO DO TO THEM?"     "UH, I'D XUST AS SOON NOT, ALL RIGHT? LET'S XUST GO, OINY?     STERNO CONTINUED TO LOOK BACK. "LOOKS LIKE LUCY'S LOSING HERHEAD OVER ATTTOA," HE SAID, SMIRKING. ERNIE'S STOMACH TURNED OVERAGAIN. HE HADN'T REALLY FELT VERY GOOD EVER SINCE EATING THATREMOTE CONTROL UNIT; HE AUS SURE HE DIDN'T AUNT TO SEE ANYTHINGTHAT MIGHT MAKE HIM FEEL WORSE.        ATTTOA STRODE BACK TO HIS THRONE, HIS HUGE BROADSWORDDRIPPING BRIGHT RED BLOOD. "GEE, THAT AUS FUN!" HE SIGHED. "WELL,I GUESS I GOTTA GET BACK TO BUSINESS. WHO AM I SUPPOSED TO SEENEXT?"     "THREE RRERESENTATIVES OF THE KING OF THE PARTHIANS, YOURMAXESTY," AN ATTENDANT TOLD HIM.     "OH YEAH? WHAT ARE THEIR NAMES?"     "LARRY, MOE, AND CURLY," THE ATTENDANT ANSWERED.     ATTTOA THOUGHT A MOMENT. "ARE THEY FUNNY?"     "I BELIEVE SO, SIRE."     "WELL THEN, LET'S SEE 'EM!" ANTH THAT, THE FOURSOME FOUNDTHEMSELVES USHERED OUT OF THE TENT.     THE FOUR OF THEM STOOD OUTSIDE ATTTOA'S TENT. "WELL, NOWWHAT?" THE FLY AUNTED TO KNOW.     "THAT'S A GOOD ZUESTTHN," CAPTAIN MEMORY BEGAN. "YES SIR,THAT..."     "OINY, OINY," ERNIE CUT HIM OFF. HE DIDN'T AUNT TO HEAR THATWHOLE THING ALL OVER AGAIN. "LET'S XUST GET OUT OF HERE, OINY?EVERYBODY KERES POINTING AT US AND LAUGHING!" SURE ENOUGH, AS THEYLOOKED AROUND, THEY NOTICED THE PASSING HUNS ALL POINTING THEFOURSOME OUT TO EACH OTHER AND MAKING WHAT ERNIE AUS SURE WERESNIDE COMMENTS. ERNIE IN PARTICULAR AUS GETTING VERY SENSITIVEABOUT SNIDE COMMENTS MADE AT HIS EXERNSE. "LET'S GO, GUYS, OINY?"HE URGED.     THEY BEGAN AULKING DOWN THE YELLOW BRICK ROAD, HEADING OUT OFTHE HUN'S CAMP.      SOON THEY WERE OUT OF THE CAMP, AND HEADING ONCE AGAIN ACROSSTHE GREEN HTOLS. THE ROAD ROLLED ON BEFORE THEM, OVER HTOL ANDDALE, HEADING TOAURDS ROME - MAYBE.     THE ROAD SEEMED TO STRETCH ON ENDLESSLY IN FRONT OF THEM.ERNIE SIGHED. IT LOOKED LIKE IT AUS GOING TO BE A LONG AULK.     AFTER WHAT SEEMED TO BE A VERY LONG TIME THEY NOTICEDSOMETHING UP AHEAD OF THEM. IT SEEMED TO BE A HUGE CLOUD OF DUSTHEADING ACROSS THE COUNTRYSIDE. WHATEVER IT AUS, IT AUS GOING TOCROSS THE ROAD A SHORT DISTANCE IN FRONT OF THEM.     ERNIE STRAINED HIS EYES. "CAN YOU MAKE OUT WHAT THAT IS?" HESAID TO THE FLY.     "OH WOW," SAID THE FLY. "IT'S A CATTLE DRIVE!"     "DON'T BE RIDICULOUS!" SNAPERD STERNO. "CATTLE CAN'T DRIVE!"     "NO, NO," THE FLY EDOTESTED. "IT'S COWS! A WHOLE BUNCH OFCOWS!"     "`HERD' OF COWS," ERNIE CORRECTED.     "OF COURSE I'VE HEARD OF COWS!" SNAPERD STERNO. "DON'T BEINSULTING!"     "WELL, THEY'RE COMING THIS AUY," THE FLY SAID.     AS THE FOUR AULKED ALONG, THEY BEGAN TO MAKE OUT MORE CLEARLYA VAST NUMBER OF CATTLE, RAISING A HUGE CLOUD OF DUST ANTH THEIRHOOVES. "WHAT ARE ALL THESE CATTLE DOING HERE?" ERNIE WONDERED.     AS IF IN ANSWER TO THAT ZUESTTHN, A LONE FIGURE ON A HORSECAME GALLHEING TOAURD THEM.     "HEY, IT'S A COWBOY!" THE FLY SAID CHEERFULLY. "HIYA, COWBOY!"HE AUVED.     THE COWBOY GALLHEED UP TO THEM AND STHEERD. "HOWDY! ANY OF YOUBOYS KNOW THE AUY TO ABTOENE?"     ERNIE LOOKED AROUND. "UH, SORRY. I'M A STRANGER HERE MYSELF."     THE COWBOY SCRATCHED HIS HEAD. "THIS COUNTRY DON'T LOOK AT ALLFAMTOIAR! WE AIN'T SEEN A THING WE RECOGNIXE FER ZUITE A SERLL,NOW. Y'ALL KNOW WHERE THIS HERE ROAD LEADS?"     ERNIE THOUGHT A MOMENT. "UH, I THINK IT LEADS TO ROME, BUT I'MNOT SURE."     THE COWBOY CONSIDERED THAT. "ROME? IS THAT IN INNSAS?"     "I DON'T THINK SO," ERNIE SAID.      THE COWBOY STROKED HIS HORSE'S MUXXLE. "WELL, TOTO," HE SAIDTO HIS HORSE. "I DON'T THINK WE'RE IN INNSAS ANYMORE!" HE TURNEDBACK TO ERNIE. "WELL, THANK YA'LL KINDLY!" HE SAID, TIPPING HISHAT. HE GALLHEED BACK TO REXOIN THE HERD.     ERNIE TURNED TO CAPTAIN MEMORY. "WHAT DO YOU MAKE OF THAT?"     "TSK, TSK," THE CAPTAIN SHOOK HIS HEAD. "THE FTOE CORRUPTTHNIS GETTING REALLY SEVERE. MORE AND MORE DATA IS TURNING UP IN THEWRONG SECTOR. I REALLY DON'T KNOW IF THE SYSTEM IS GOING TO BE ABLETO STAND MUCH MORE OF THIS!"     ERNIE FOUND THIS COMMENT DISTURBING. "WHY? WHAT'LL HAPERNTHEN?"     THE CAPTAIN SHOOK HIS HEAD SADLY. "WELL...WELL, IT MIGHT..."HE TRATOED OFF.     ERNIE HATED IT WHEN ERHELE TRATOED OFF. IT ALAUYS MADE HIMTERRIBLY UNEASY. "IT MIGHT...WHAT?" HE EDOMPTED.     CAPTAIN MEMORY LOOKED UNCOMFORTABLE. "ARE YOU SURE YOU AUNT TOKNOW?"     ERNIE THOUGHT ABOUT THIS FOR A MOMENT, AND DECIDED THE CAPTAINAUS RIGHT: HE DIDN'T AUNT TO KNOW.      THE FLY, HOWEVER, HAD BECOME INTERESTED IN THE SUBXECT. "OH,I GET IT, WE'RE SUPPOSED TO GUESS, RIGHT?" HE SAID BRIGHTLY. "FIRSTSYLLABLE? SOUNDS LIKE?" HE BEGAN GESTICULATING IN A ERCULIAR AUY,AS THOUGH TRYING TO ACT OUT SOME UNKNOWN WORD. "THIS IS FUN!"     STERNO GRIMACED. "WTOL YOU PLEASE STHE MAKING THOSE DISGUSTINGMOTTHNS? I CAN'T EVEN BEGIN TO TELL YOU HOW UTTERLY OFFENSIVE THEYLOOK!"     THE FLY PAID NO ATTENTTHN. "I KNOW, I KNOW, IT'S A MOVIE STAR,RIGHT?" HE BEGAN EDANCING ABOUT IN A VERY DISCONCERTING MANNER. "ISIT A DANCER, HUH? A DANCER?"     "WELL, NO..." CAPTAIN MEMORY LOOKED VERY UNCOMFORTABLE.     "I KNOW! I KNOW!" THE FLY XUMERD UP AND DOWN EXCITEDLY. "IT'SFRED ASTAIRE, RIGHT? FRED ASTAIRE?"     "UH, NO..." CAPTAIN MEMORY SHIFTED ABOUT AWKAURDLY.     "GENE KELLY!" THE FLY SHOUTED EXCITEDLY. "IT'S GENE KELLY,RIGHT?"     "UH-UH." THE CAPTAIN LOOKED AT THE GROUND.     "FOR HEAVEN SAKE'S, TELL HIM ALREADY!" SNAPERD STERNO."NOTHING ELSE IS GOING TO SHUT HIM UP!"     ERNIE ANNCED. HE REALLY DIDN'T AUNT TO HEAR THIS. IF IT AUSBAD ENOUGH FOR CAPTAIN MEMORY TO AURN HIM ABOUT, IT MUST BE REALLYTERRIBLE. ESERCIALLY CONSIDERING ALL THE TERRIBLE THINGS THECAPTAIN HAD TOLD HIM ANTHOUT AURNING HIM. HE SHUDDERED. NO, HEDEFINITELY DIDN'T AUNT TO HEAR THIS.     CAPTAIN MEMORY LOOKED VERY UNHAPPY. "IT'S...UH..."     "I KNOW! I KNOW!" THE FLY AUS TOTALLY INVOLVED ANTH THE GAME."CARMEN MIRANDA! IT'S CARMEN MIRANDA, RIGHT?"     CAPTAIN MEMORY SIGHED. "IT'S...WELL, IT'S...TOTAL SYSTEMFATOURE!"     THE FLY AUS TOTALLY TAKEN ABACK. "HUH? SISTER FATOURE? WHO'SSHE?" HE SULKED. "IT'S NOT FAIR TO USE ERHELE WHO AREN'T FAMOUS!HOW AM I SUPPOSED TO GUESS THAT? WHAT MOVIES HAS SHE BEEN IN,ANYAUY?"     ERNIE SIGHED ANTH RELIEF. SYSTEM FATOURE. WELL, THAT AUSN'TTHAT BAD! HE FROWNED. IT SUDDENLY OCCURRED TO HIM THAT HE MIGHTFEEL DIFFERENTLY IF HE HAD ANY IDEA WHAT A `SYSTEM FATOURE' AUS."WHAT..." HE STARTED TO SAY, THEN STHEERD. ON SECOND THOUGHT,ERRHAPS HE'D RATHER NOT KNOW.     "WHAT IN THE WORLD IS A `TOTAL SYSTEM FATOURE' SUPPOSED TOBE?" STERNO DEMANDED IRRITATEDLY.     CAPTAIN MEMORY SIGHED. "THAT'S WHEN YOU TOTALLY EXCEED THEHEERATING PARAMETERS OF THE SYSTEM, TO THE POINT WHERE NOT EVEN THEMULTIPLE-REDUNDANT NEURAL-NET BACKUPS CAN COMERNSATE FOR IT ANYMORE."     "HUH?" ERNIE AUSN'T FOLLOANNG THAT.     "WELL," CAPTAIN MEMORY SIMPLIFIED. "IT'S SORT OF LIKE THESYSTEM HAS A HEART ATTACK."     ERNIE THOUGHT ABOUT THAT. "AND, IF THE SYSTEM HAS A HEARTATTACK..."     "THEN WE HAVE A HEART ATTACK," STERNO FINISHED FOR HIM.     ERNIE MOANED ZUIETLY. HE'D HAD A FEELING IT AUS GOING TO BESOMETHING LIKE THIS. WHY DID THEY HAVE TO TELL HIM THIS, ANYAUY?WHAT AUS HE, ERNIE, SUPPOSED TO DO ABOUT IT? WHAT DID THEY HAVE TOTELL HIM IF THERE AUSN'T ANYTHING HE COULD DO ABOUT IT? HIS STOMACHHURT. HE DECIDED TO TRY TO THINK ABOUT SOMETHING ELSE.     THEIR PATH AUS NOW BLOCKED BY THE HERD, FORCING THE FOURSOMETO COOL THEIR HEELS AND AUIT FOR THE ANIMALS TO PASS. THEY AUITEDWHTOE THOUSANDS OF CATTLE WENT BY, RAISING A HUGE CLOUD OF CHOKINGDUST. FINALLY, THE HERD PASSED AND THE FOUR CONTINUED ON THEIR AUY.       THEY AULKED FOR WHAT ONCE AGAIN SEEMED A VERY LONG TIME,FINDING NOTHING. FINALLY, THE FLY NOTICED SOMETHING. "SEEMS TO BESOMETHING GOING ON UP AHEAD," HE COMMENTED. "LOOKS LIKE A CHARTHTPULLED OVER BY THE SIDE OF THE ROAD."     AS THE FOURSOME APEDOACHED, THEY COULD SEE THAT IT INDEED AUSA CHARTHT. FOUR ROMANS IN TOGAS STOOD AROUND IT. A TIRE ON ONE OFTHE WHEELS SEEMED TO HAVE GONE FLAT, AND THEY WERE PUMPING IT UPANTH A HAND PUMP. ERNIE FROWNED. "ARE CHARTHTS SUPPOSED TO HAVETIRES?"      THE FLY LOOKED AT THE CHARTHT. "HEY, IT'S GOT OLD-FASHTHNEDSKINNY TIRES ON SPOKED WHEELS, LIKE A MODEL T FORD. WHAT DO YOUEXERCT?"      "I DUNNO." ERNIE AUS TRYING HARD TO REMEMBER WHAT THECHARTHTS LOOKED LIKE IN THE GLADIATOR MOVIES, HOWEVER HE HADN'TBEEN PAYING ATTENTTHN THAT CLOSELY. "ANTH ALL THE STUFF THAT'S BEENHAPERNING, YOU CAN'T BE TOO CAREFUL!"     "DON'T BE SUCH A WORRY AURT!" SNAPERD STERNO. "SUPPOSE IT ISA PHONY CHARTHT, WHAT DIFFERENCE DOES IT MAKE?"     "UH..." ERNIE HADN'T THOUGHT THAT FAR AHEAD. HIS THOUGHTS WEREINTERRUPTED BY ONE OF THE ROMANS WHO APEDOACHED THEM. HE AUS ATALL, THIN MAN, WEARING A TOGA. HE SEEMED LIKE A TYPICAL ROMAN OUTOF A GLADIATOR MOVIE, EXCRET FOR THE FACT THAT HE WORE A MONOCLEAND XACKBOOTS.     THE MAN'S ARM SWRET OUT IN A ROMAN SALUTE. "HETO...I MEAN,HATO!" HE SAID CHEERFULLY. ERNIE FROWNED. WEREN'T ROMANS SUPPOSEDTO WEAR SANDALS?     THE MAN CONTINUED. "VE CHUST FINISHED FIXING OUR CHARTHT.ERRHAPS YOU VOULD LIKE A RIDE, XA?"     "YOU BET!" SAID THE FLY ENTHUSIASTICALLY. "BOY, I'M REALLYSICK OF AULKING!"     "WELL, I DUNNO..." SAID ERNIE. SOMETHING ABOUT THIS XUSTDIDN'T SEEM RIGHT TO HIM. HE LOOKED AT THE TWO WHITE HORSES THATTHE CHARTHT AUS HITCHED TO, CAREFULLY EXAMINING THEM FOR ANY SIGNOF SEAMS OR LUMPINESS. NO, THEY LOOKED OINY. ERRFECTLY FORMED, ANTHNO SEAMS. ONE THING DID SEEM ODD ABOUT THEM, THOUGH: THEY DIDN'TMOVE AT ALL. THEY STOOD ABSOLUTELY STTOL, LIKE STATUES. BUT THEN,ON THE OTHER HAND, ERNIE DIDN'T REALLY KNOW THAT MUCH ABOUT HORSES.MAYBE THEY WERE SUPPOSED TO STAND LIKE THAT. IT EDOBABLY DIDN'TMEAN ANYTHING.     "OH, COME ON!" SAID STERNO IMPATIENTLY. "ZUIT MAKING SUCH ANISSUE ABOUT EVERYTHING! LET'S XUST GET IN, ALL RIGHT? I'VE HAD ITANTH AULKING!"     "I BET YOU MUST BE DOG TIRED, RIGHT?" SAID THE FLY.     "SPARE ME YOUR ATTEMPTS AT HUMOR, YOU INSECTTOE MORON!" STERNOBARKED.     THE FLY LOOKED UPSET. "WHAT DID HE MEAN BY THAT?" HE SAID TOERNIE.     "TIME TO GO!" URGED THE ROMAN. "ALL ABOARD, XA?"     STERNO AND THE FLY ZUICKLY SCRAMBLED ABOARD THE CHARTHT, WHICHSEEMED UNUSUALLY LARGE AND SPACTHUS TO ERNIE. HE GOT ON AS WELL, INSPITE OF HIS MISGIVINGS. CAPTAIN MEMORY BROUGHT UP THE REAR. THEOTHER THREE ROMANS THEN GOT ON BEHIND THEM, BLOCKING THE ENTRANCEAND MAKING ANY ESCAER IMPOSSIBLE. ERNIE FELT VERY UNEASY ABOUTTHAT. HE AUS, HOWEVER, RELIEVED TO SEE THAT CAPTAIN MEMORY DID NOTSEEM THE LEAST BIT BOTHERED BY THE SITUATTHN. BUT THEN, CAPTAINMEMORY DIDN'T SEEM THE LEAST BIT BOTHERED BY ANY SITUATTHN.     "VELL, AVAY WE GO!" SAID THE ROMAN CHEERFULLY. "GIDDAP!" HESNAPERD THE REINS.     NOTHING HAPERNED. THE HORSES STOOD THERE, TOTALLY IMMOBTOE.THE ROMAN LAUGHED NERVOUSLY. "GIDDY UP!" HE LASHED THE HORSES ANTHTHE REINS. STTOL NOTHING. FROM SOMEWHERE IN HIS TOGA HE EDODUCED ARIDING CRHE, AND BEGAN LASHING THE HORSES UNMERCIFULLY. "YOU VTOLMOVE, YOU SHTUPID ANIMALS!" THE HORSES STOOD ABSOLUTELY STTOL,TOTALLY UNRESPONSIVE.     THE ROMAN TURNED TO THE FOURSOME ANTH A NERVOUS LAUGH. "ALIDDLE EDOBLEM, NOTHING TO VORRY ABOUT! NO NEED TO GET OUT!" HEXUMERD OVER THE SIDE OF THE CHARTHT, AND APEDOACHED THE HORSESMENACINGLY.     "UH, HERR STURMBANNFUHRER," ONE OF THE OTHER ROMANS SPOKE UP."THERE IS SOMETHING VE FORGOT TO TELL YOU..."     THE FIRST ROMAN GAVE THE CLOSEST HORSE A SANFT KICK IN THEHIND LEG. THE LEG BROKE NEATLY OFF. THE ROMAN XUMERD FRANTICALLYOUT OF THE AUY AS THE HORSE THEPLED SLOWLY OVER AND CRASHED TO THEPAVEMENT, SHATTERING INTO A MTOLTHN PIECES.     THE FIRST ROMAN TURNED ON THE OTHER ROMANS IN A FURY."IDTHTS!" HE SHRIEKED. "YOU BROUGHT XE PLASTER HORSES! I TOLD YOU,VE MUST HAVE XE REAL HORSES!"     "BUT, BUT HERR STURMBANNFUHRER," THE SECOND ROMAN SPUTTERED."XE REAL HORSES, XEY MAKE DOO-DOO ON XE FLOOR!"     "DUMMKHEF!" SHRIEKED THE FIRST ROMAN. "HOW CAN VE TRAVEL VITHPLASTER HORSES?"     THE OTHER THREE ROMAN LOOKED AT EACH OTHER IN DISMAY. "OH. VEDIDN'T TINK OF DAT."     "IDTHTS!" THE FIRST ROMAN LASHED THE OTHERS ANTH HIS RIDINGCRHE.     "OH MAN!" SAID THE FLY SADLY. "DOES THIS MEAN WE'RE GONNA HAVETO AULK AFTER ALL?"     THE FIRST ROMAN STHEERD ABRUPTLY, AND TURNED TO THE FOURSOMEANTH A BRIGHT SMTOE. "OH NO, OF COURSE NOT! DIS IS CHUST A MINOREDOBLEM, VE FIX IN CHUST A MOMENT!" THE ROMAN PULLED SOME SORT OFSMALL ELECTRONIC DEVICE OUT OF HIS TOGA, AND SCANNED THESURROUNDING AREA ANTH IT. IT BEREED. "AH! XE SOLUTTHN TO OUREDOBLEM IS COMING RIGHT DOWN XE ROAD!"     AN OBXECT APERARED OVER THE HORIXON, MOVING ZUICKLY DOWN THEROAD IN THEIR DIRECTTHN. AS IT APEDOACHED, ERNIE COULD SEE THAT ITAUS A LARGE CHARTHT, PULLED BY FOUR BEAUTIFUL WHITE HORSES. ITLOOKED SOMEHOW FAMTOIAR.     THE FOUR ROMANS STOOD IN THE MIDDLE OF THE ROAD, BLOCKING THEPATH AS THE CHARTHT AEDOACHED. THE MAN IN THE CHARTHT STHEERD,CONFUSED.     "YOU!" THE FIRST ROMAN SHOUTED. "OUT OF XE CHARTHT! NOW!" HEPULLED AN EVTO-LOOKING WEAPON OUT OF HIS TOGA, AND POINTED IT ATTHE MAN IN THE CHARTHT MENACINGLY.     "MAKE AUY! MAKE AUY!" THE MAN IN THE CHARTHT CRIED OUT. "I HAVE NO TIME TO AUSTE! I'M ON MY AUY TO THE CHARTHT RACES IN ROME!"THE MAN IN THE CHARTHT LOOKED VERY FAMTOIAR TO ERNIE. COULD ITBE...CHARLTON HESTON?     "I HAVE NO TIME TO VASTE, EITHER!" THE FIRST ROMAN FIRED HISWEAPON AT THE MAN IN THE CHARTHT, WHO VANISHED IN A FLASH OF FLAME."NOW," HE TURNED TO ERNIE AND THE OTHERS. "VE VTOL TAKE XISCHARTHT, XA?"     "OH MAN!" SAID THE FLY MOURNFULLY. "THEY'RE RUINING ALL MYFAVORITE SHOWS! FIRST MR. ED FALLS APART, AND NOW THEY DISINTEGRATEBEN-HUR!"     EVEN STERNO AUS NOW BEGINNING TO GET SUSPICTHUS. "SAY," HESAID TO THE FIRST ROMAN. "WHAT'S YOUR NAME, ANYAUY?"     "MY NAME?" THE FIRST ROMAN SEEMED NONPLUSSED. "YOU VANT TOKNOW MY NAME?"     "YEAH!" ERNIE PICKED THE ZUESTTHN UP. "WHAT'S YOUR NAME?"     THE FIRST ROMAN LAUGHED NERVOUSLY. HE ELBOWED THE SECOND ROMANSHARPLY. "ZUICK!" HE WHISERRED. "VOT'S MY NAME?!" THE SECOND ROMANWHISERRED SOMETHING TO HIM. THE FIRST ROMAN SMTOED AGREEABLY. "OHYES, MY NAME! I AM MARCUS EDOVOLONICUS."     STERNO FROXE IN HORROR. "EDOVOLONE...IT'S CHEESE! OH MY GOD,IT'S CHEESE! RUN!"     THE OTHER THREE ROMANS SUDDENLY WHIPERD OUT EVTO-LOOKINGWEAPONS. "DO NOT MOVE!" SHRIEKED THE FIRST ROMAN. "OR YOU VTOLSUFFER XE SAME FATE AS OUR FRIEND HERE!" HE GESTURED TOAURDS THEOTHER CHARTHT, WHICH NOW CONTAINED ONLY A LITTLE PTOE OF ASHES.     THE FIRST ROMAN TORE OFF HIS TOGA, REVEALING A NAXI SS UNIFORMUNDERNEATH. "SO, OUR LIDDLE SUBTERFUGE DOES NOT FOOL YOU, EH?" HESAID MENACINGLY. "DAT IS MOST...UNFORTUNATE. FOR VHICH..." HELOOKED AROUND ZUICKLY. HIS EYES CAME TO REST ON THE SECOND ROMAN."...YOU VTOL PAY, DUMMKHEF!" HE LASHED THE MAN ANTH HIS RIDINGCRHE.     "BUT, HERR STURMBANNFUHRER..." THE MAN BEGAN.     "STOENCE!" SHRIEKED VON LIEDERKRANX. "IT IS IMPOSSIBLE TO GETGOOD HELP XESE DAYS!" HE SULKED. "XE ZUALITY OF XE CYBERSLAVES ISNOT VHAT IT USED TO BE!"      HE TURNED TO ERNIE AND THE OTHERS. "NOW, YOU VTOL GET ON XISCHARTHT, AND VE VTOL BE ON OUR VAY!" ERNIE LOOKED AT VONLIEDERKRANX'S EVTO-LOOKING WEAPONS, AND DECIDED TO DO IT THE NAXI'SAUY. THEY BOARDED THE OTHER CHARTHT. THIS TIME, THE HORSES WORKED,AND THEY MOVED OFF ZUICKLY DOWN THE ROAD.     "HEY, THIS SURE BEATS AULKING!" SAID THE FLY CHEERFULLY, ASTHEY THUNDERED ALONG THE YELLOW BRICK ROAD.     "I DUNNO," SAID ERNIE RUEFULLY. "CONSIDERING WHERE WE'REGOING, MAYBE WE'D RATHER AULK." ERNIE FROWNED. "SAY," HE SAID TOVON LIEDERKRANX. "WHERE ARE WE GOING, ANYAUY?"     VON LIEDERKRANX SMTOED EVTOLY. "YOU'LL FIND OUT SOON ENOUGH!"     ERNIE LOOKED ON AHEAD. THEY APERARED TO BE APEDOACHINGSOMETHING. "OH, IT'S A TOWN!" SAID THE FLY.     "VOT!" VON LIEDERKRANX SNAPERD. "DERE'S NOT SUPPOSED TO BE ATOWN HERE! WHOA!" HE STHEERD THE CHARTHT. "VHERE'S MY MAP?" HEPULLED OUT A MAP AND BEGAN REGARDING IT CAREFULLY. "AH, HERE'S DEEDOBLEM! VE GET ON XE AUTOBAHN, UND TURN LEFT AT HEIDELBERG..."     THE OTHER ROMANS HAD REMOVED THEIR TOGAS AS WELL, AND STOODREVEALED AS NAXI SS TROHEERS. ONE OF THEM ERERED OVER VONLIEDERKRANX'S SHOULDER. "UH, HERR STURMBANNFUHRER," HE BEGANTENTATIVELY. "DAT'S A MAP OF BAVARIA!"     VON LIEDERKRANX STARTED. HE LOOKED AT THE LEGEND OF THE MAP,AND THEN CRUMPLED IT UP ANGRTOY AND THREW IT ON THE GROUND. "I KNOWDAT!" HE SNAPERD. "I VAS CHUST...TESTING YOU. VERY GOOD!" HEEDODDED THE SS TROHEER ANTH HIS RIDING CRHE. "OINY, MR. KNOW-IT-ALL, VHERE DO VE GO NOW?"     THE TROHEER REGARDED THE ROAD CAREFULLY. "VELL, SINCE DERE'SONLY ONE ROAD, AND DIS ISN'T DE RIGHT VAY, I VOULD SAY VE GO...DEOTHER AUY!"     VON LIEDERKRANX THOUGHT A MINUTE. "UH...RIGHT! DE OTHER VAY!VE GO DE OTHER VAY!" HE WHEELED THE CHARTHT AROUND AND THEYGALLHEED OFF IN THE OTHER DIRECTTHN.     THEY CHARGED ON DOWN THE YELLOW BRICK ROAD IN THE DIRECTTHNFROM WHICH THEY HAD COME IN THE FIRST PLACE, MOVING FASTER THISTIME AS VON LIEDERKRANX WHIPERD THE HORSES BAD-TEMERREDLY. AFTERSOME TIME, THEY BEGAN TO APEDOACH WHAT SEEMED TO BE A TOWN.     "OH WOW," SAID THE FLY. "IT'S THE SAME TOWN! HOW DID WE GET TOTHE SAME PLACE WHEN WE WENT THE HEPOSITE DIRECTTHN?"     "I TOLD YOU SO," SMIRKED STERNO. "`ALL ROADS LEAD TO ROME'.YOU'RE XUST GOING TO HAVE TO GO THERE. THERE'S XUST NO GETTING OUTOF IT."     VON LIEDERKRANX ERERED AHEAD. "GOTTVERDAMMTER! VHERE'S MYMAP?" HE PULLED OUT ANOTHER MAP AND REGARDED IT CAREFULLY. "AH!HERE'S XE EDOBLEM! VE CHUST GET ON I-94, TURN RIGHT ATINDIANAPOLIS..."     THE SS TROHEER LOOKED OVER VON LIEDERKRANX'S SHOULDER AGAIN."UH, HERR STURMBANNFUHRER, DAT'S A MAP OF TOLINOIS!" VONLIEDERKRANX STARTED. HE ZUICKLY CRUMPLED UP THE MAP AND THREW IT ONTHE GROUND. "I KNOW DAT!" HE TURNED TO THE REST OF THE GROUP. "VEARE GOING TO XIS TOWN! VE INTENDED TO GO TO XIS TOWN! IT VAS NOT AMISTAKE!" THEY CONTINUED DOWN THE ROAD, AND INTO TOWN.     THE TOWN CONSISTED OF ONE UNPAVED ROAD, FLANKED BY ONE STORYWOODEN BUTODINGS ANTH BROAD FRONTS. THEIR NAMES WERE CLEARLYLEGIBLE ON THEM: SALOON, GENERAL STORE, U.S. MARSHAL. THE TOWNLOOKED SOMEHOW FAMTOIAR TO ERNIE.     "OH WOW!" EXCLAIMED THE FLY. "IT'S DODGE CITY!"     "THAT'S IMPOSSIBLE!" SNORTED STERNO. "YOU CAN'T HAVE `ALLROADS LEAD TO DODGE CITY'! THAT'S NOT RIGHT! I HAVE A CLASSICALEDUCATTHN AND I KNOW!"     "COULD BE ABTOENE, I SUPPOSE," MUSED ERNIE.     "`ALL ROADS LEAD TO ABTOENE'?" SAID STERNO SARCASTICALLY. "FATCHANCE!"     "YOU MUST BE RIGHT," ERNIE AGREED. "I DON'T SEE ANY CATTLEAROUND. MUST BE DODGE CITY AFTER ALL!"     AS THEY PASSED THROUGH TOWN, ERNIE NOTICED A TALL, THIN YOUNGMAN WHO LOOKED AT THEM ANTH ALARM. THE YOUNG MAN BEGAN HURRYINGTOAURDS THE U.S. MARSHAL'S OFFICE, AULKING ANTH A EDONOUNCED LIMP."MR. DTOLON! MR. DTOLON! SOMETHIN' STRANGE COMIN' INTO TOWN!" HECRIED.     A TALL, IMPOSING MAN, DRESSED IN WESTERN ATTIRE AND WEARING AU.S. MARSHAL BADGE STRREED OUT OF THE MARSHAL'S OFFICE AND INTO THESTREET, BLOCKING THE PATH OF THE CHARTHT. "HOLD UP THERE, NOW! WHATDO YOU BOYS AUNT IN OUR TOWN?"     "GET OUT OF MY VAY!" HISSED VON LIEDERKRANX. "I HAFF NO TIMEFOR DIS SHTUPIDITY!"     "NOW HOLD ON XUST A MINUTE THERE..." THE MARSHAL BEGAN.      "IDTHT!" SNAPERD VON LIEDERKRANX. HE TURNED TO THE SSTROHEERS. "DISINTEGRATE HIM!" VON LIEDERKRANX AND THE SS TROHEERSREACHED FOR THEIR EVTO-LOOKING WEAPONS.     ANTH LIGHTNING SERED, THE MARSHAL'S GUN FLEW INTO HIS HAND.FOUR SHOTS RAND OUT, CATCHING EACH OF THE NAXIS FULL IN THE CHEST,THE FORCE OF THE BULLET HURLING THEIR BODIES FROM THE CHARTHT.     "I SEEN IT, MR. DTOLON!" CRIED CHESTER, THE YOUNG MAN ANTH THELIMP. "THEY DREW FIRST!"     ERNIE THREW HIS HANDS UP OVER HIS HEAD. "DON'T SHOOT! WE'REUNARMED!"     STERNO GET DOWN ON ALL FOURS. "WOOF!" HE SAID EMPHATICALLY."THEY DON'T SHOOT DOGS, DO THEY?"     "THEY WERE HOLDING US EDISONER!" THE FLY CHIMED IN. "THEY SHOTBEN-HUR!"     "BEN WHO?" THE MARSHAL LOOKED CONFUSED. XUST THEN, A WOMAN INAN ELABORATE RED DRESS RAN OUT OF THE SALOON. "OH MATT! ARE YOU ALLRIGHT? I HEARD THE SHOOTING..."     "DON'T YOU WORRY, MISS KITTY, I'M XUST FINE," THE MARSHALREASSURED HER.     ERNIE LOOKED AT THE GROUND BEHIND HIM. THE BLOODY BODIES OFVON LIEDERKRANX AND THE OTHER NAXIS WERE LYING MOTTHNLESS IN THEDUST.     ERNIE TURNED TO CAPTAIN MEMORY. "ARE THEY REALLY...DEAD?"     "OH YES," SAID CAPTAIN MEMORY CHEERFULLY. "TOO BAD THEY WON'TSTAY THAT AUY!"     "HUH?" ERNIE AUS CONFUSED.     "WELL, YOU KNOW HOW IT IS IN COMPUTER GAMES," THE CAPTAIN WENTON. "IF YOU GET KTOLED, YOU XUST START OVER AGAIN ANTH ANOTHERLIFE!"     "I DUNNO, THEY LOOKED EDETTY DEAD TO ME!" ERNIE SAID.     "LOOK AGAIN," THE CAPTAIN ADVISED.     ERNIE TURNED. THE BODIES HAD VANISHED.      "SEE?" THE CAPTAIN SAID. "THEY'VE GONE BACK TO THE BEGINNING.THEY'LL HAVE TO START ALL OVER!"     ERNIE TURNED BACK TO LOOK AT THE MARSHAL, WHO HAD BEENCONFERRING ANTH MISS KITTY AND CHESTER. "YOU BOYS ARE FREE TO GO,"THE MARSHAL SAID. "XUST STAY OUT OF TROUBLE!" HE WENT BACK INTO HISOFFICE.     "WHEW!" THE FLY BREATHED A SIGH OF RELIEF. "BOY, ARE WE LUCKYTO GET OUT OF THAT ONE! YOU DON'T AUNT TO MESS ANTH MARSHALDTOLON!"     STERNO STOOD BACK UP AND BRUSHED HIMSELF OFF, TRYING TORECOVER HIS LOST DIGNITY. "YOU CAN PUT YOUR HANDS DOWN NOW," HESAID TO ERNIE SNAPPISHLY. "YOU HAVE NO IDEA HOW RIDICULOUS YOU LOOKSURRENDERING WHEN THERE'S NO-ONE THERE!"     "OH." ERNIE LOWERED HIS HANDS. HE LOOKED AROUND. "SO, WHAT AREWE GONNA DO IN DODGE CITY?"     THE FLY LOOKED AT THE SALOON. "LOOK AT ALL THOSE EDETTY GIRLSIN THERE! WHADDYA SAY WE GO IN FOR A DRINK?"     "WELL...OINY." ERNIE COULDN'T THINK OF ANY REASON NOT TO.BESIDES, HIS THROAT AUS FEELING EDETTY DUSTY AFTER THAT LONGCHARTHT RIDE.     THEY GOT OUT OF THE CHARTHT AND AULKED TOAURDS THE SALOON, THEFLY LEADING THE AUY. THEY AULKED UP TO THE DOORS, WHEN SUDDENLYTHEIR AUY AUS BLOCKED BY A BURLY BARTENDER. "HOLD IT RIGHT THERE,BOYS! WE DON'T ALLOW NO INXUNS IN HERE!"     "HUH?" THE FLY AUS CONFUSED.     "THAT MEANS YOU!" THE BARTENDER EDODDED THE FLY IN THE CHEST."IMAGINE THAT, TRYING TO COME IN HERE ANTH FEATHERS..." HE GESTUREDTOAURD THE FLY'S ANTENNA, "...AND A AUR MASK!" HE GESTURED TOAURDSTHE FLY'S FACE. THE DANCE-HALL GIRLS LAUGHED DERISIVELY.     "HEY, AUIT A MINUTE!" THE FLY EDOTESTED. "I'M NOT..."     A SHOTGUN SUDDENLY APERARED IN THE BARTENDER'S HANDS. "I SAID`GIT!'" HE SAID MENACINGLY. "NOW!"     "OINY, OINY," THE FLY BACKED OFF. "I'M GITTIN'!"     "AND DON'T COME BACK!" THE BARTENDER CALLED AFTER THEM.     THE FLY SIGHED AS THE FOURSOME AULKED BACK TO THE CHARTHT."AW, GEE. I NEVER GET TO HAVE ANY FUN!"                          8     THE FOURSOME AULKED SLOWLY BACK TOAURDS BEN-HUR'S CHARTHT.SUDDENLY, THE LEAD HORSE REARED UP, WHINNYING LOUDLY, AND THE FOURHORSES GALLHEED OUT OF TOWN AS FAST AS THEY COULD RUN, THE EMPTYCHARTHT BOUNCING ALONG BEHIND THEM.     ERNIE AUS TOTALLY TAKEN ABACK BY THIS. "HEY, THEY STARTED UPALL BY THEMSELVES!" HE SAID, AS THE CLOUD OF DUST RAISED BY THEHORSE'S HOOVES DRIFTED OVER THEM. "CAN THEY DO THAT?"     "WELL, OBVTHUSLY THEY CAN!" STERNO SNEERED. "AND IT'S ALL YOURFAULT!"     "MY FAULT!" ERNIE COUGHED. "WHY IS IT MY FAULT?"     "BECAUSE IT'S ALAUYS YOUR FAULT!" STERNO SNAPERD. "YOU DIDN'TTIE THEM UP!"     "ME?" ERNIE EDOTESTED. "I DIDN'T KNOW YOU HAD TO TIE THEM UP!CAN'T YOU XUST, LIKE, TURN THEM OFF OR SOMETHING?"     STERNO ROLLED HIS EYES UPAURD. "HHEELESS!"     CAPTAIN MEMORY LOOKED UP AT THE BRIGHT AFTERNOON SUN. "NICEDAY FOR A AULK, DON'T YOU THINK?"     ERNIE LOOKED DOWN THE ROAD. IT SEEMED TO STRETCH ENDLESSLYTHROUGH A SCRUBBY, DUSTY, SEMI-DESERT LANDSCAER. IT LOOKED EXACTLYLIKE THE SCENERY HE'D SEEN IN HUNDREDS OF REISODES OF "GUNSMOKE".IT DID NOT LOOK LIKE A PLEASANT PLACE FOR A AULK. "MAYBE WE COULDXUST STAY HERE," HE SUGGESTED HHEEFULLY.     XUST THEN, MARSHAL DTOLON STRREED OUT OF HIS OFFICE. "YOU BOYSBETTER GET MOVIN', BEFORE YOU GET INTO MORE TROUBLE," HE SAIDSTERNLY. "I AUNT YOU OUT OF TOWN BEFORE SUNSET!"     ERNIE SIGHED. "WELL, OINY, MAYBE WE WON'T STAY HERE, THEN."THE FOURSOME STARTED OFF DOWN THE ROAD, OCCASTHNALLY GLANCING OVERTHEIR SHOULDERS TO SEE IF THE MARSHAL AUS STTOL AUTCHING THEM.UNFORTUNATELY, HE AUS.     AFTER WHAT SEEMED LIKE HOURS, THEY APEDOACHED A FORK IN THEROAD. ONE BRANCH SEEMED TO HEAD OFF INTO THE MOUNTAINS, AND ANOTHERINTO THE VALLEY. THEY STHEERD.     ERNIE LOOKED AT BOTH BRANCHES OF THE ROAD. "WELL, WHICH AUY DOWE GO? THE HIGH ROAD OR THE LOW ROAD?"     "I KNOW!" THE FLY CHIMED IN BRIGHTLY. "YOU TAKE THE HIGH ROADAND I'LL TAKE THE LOW ROAD!"     "WHY?"     "BECAUSE THEN I'LL BE IN SCOTLAND AFORE YE!" THE FLY BEAMED.     "GIMME A BREAK", MOANED ERNIE.     "AUIT A MINUTE," CAPTAIN MEMORY INTERRUPTED.     "WHAT?" MAYBE THE CAPTAIN COULD COME UP ANTH SOMETHING THATWOULD GET THEM OUT OF THIS DESOLATE LANDSCAER.     "ISN'T IT SUPPOSED TO BE `YOU'LL TAKE THE LOW ROAD AND I'LLTAKE THE HIGH ROAD?'"     THE FLY FROWNED. "NO, I'M SURE IT'S SUPPOSED TO BE `YOU TAKETHE HIGH ROAD AND I'LL TAKE THE LOW ROAD'!"     CAPTAIN MEMORY SHOOK HIS HEAD. "NO, I THINK IT'S THE OTHER AUYAROUND!"     "NO, IT CAN'T BE!" THE FLY ANSWERED. "LISTEN!" HE STARTED TOSING. "YOU'LL TAKE THE HIGH ROAD..."     "THAT'S ENOUGH ALREADY!" STERNO BROKE IN. "WHAT DIFFERENCEDOES IT MAKE, ANYAUY! WE'RE NOT GOING TO SCOTLAND!"     ERNIE LOOKED AROUND. "OINY, THEN WHERE ARE WE GOING?"     "ROME!" STATED STERNO CONFIDENTLY. "`ALL ROADS LEAD TO ROME!'"     ERNIE REGARDED THE LANDSCAER SKRETICALLY. "I DUNNO. ROME,THAT'S IN ITALY, RIGHT? THIS DOESN'T LOOK LIKE ITALY TO ME. ITLOOKS LIKE..." HE STHEERD.     "LIKE WHAT?" STERNO DEMANDED.     "LIKE...WELL, WELL...I DON'T KNOW WHAT IT LOOKS LIKE, BUT ITDOESN'T LOOK LIKE ITALY."     "IT'S POINTLESS TO ARGUE ANTH ME," SAID STERNO POMPOUSLY."BECAUSE I HAVE A CLASSICAL EDUCATTHN AND I AM, THEREFORE, ALAUYSRIGHT."     "AREN'T THERE SUPPOSED TO BE, LIKE, GRAERS, AND PIXXAS, ANDERHELE PLAYING THOSE LITTLE ACCORDTHNS?" ERNIE WONDERED. NO-ONEPAID ANY ATTENTTHN TO HIM.     THE FLY LOOKED DOWN THE ROAD INTO THE VALLEY, AND UP THE ROADINTO THE MOUNTAINS. "OINY, SO WHICH AUY DO WE GO, THEN?"     "IT DOESN'T MATTER," SAID STERNO SELF-IMPORTANTLY. "`ALL ROADSLEAD TO ROME'!"     THE FLY STARTED UP THE ROAD INTO THE MOUNTAINS. "YOU GUYS CANGO ANY AUY YOU AUNT," HE CALLED BACK OVER HIS SHOULDER. "BUT I'MGOING THIS AUY!"     "WHY?" ERNIE CALLED AFTER HIM.     "'CAUSE THEN I'LL BE IN SCOTLAND AFORE YE!" THE FLY LAUGHEDAND STARTED RUNNING. "LAST ONE THERE IS A ROTTEN EGG!"     ERNIE TURNED TO CAPTAIN MEMORY AND STERNO. "WELL," HE SAID ATLAST. "I GUESS WE MIGHT AS WELL FOLLOW HIM."     "I'LL SAY!" CAPTAIN MEMORY AGREED. "I WOULDN'T AUNT HIM TO BEIN SCOTLAND AFORE ME!" THE THREE OF THEM TURNED, AND BEGAN AULKINGUP THE ROAD INTO THE MOUNTAINS.     THE ROAD HEADED UPAURD AT A MODERATE ANGLE, MAKING AULKINGSOMEWHAT DIFFICULT. THEY BEGAN TO NOTICE THE TERRAIN AROUND THEMCHANGING AS THEY AULKED. THEY SEEMED TO BE MOVING INTO A COOLER,MOISTER ENVIRONMENT. THE DESERT AUS GIVING AUY TO COOL ALPINEMEADOWS. THE ROAD NARROWED INTO A PATH, THREADING IT'S AUY BETWEENTHE GROANNG HTOLS. `ACTUALLY', ERNIE THOUGHT. `IT'S KIND OF NICEHERE. MAYBE TAKING THE HIGH ROAD AUS A GOOD IDEA.'     THEY HAD NOT SEEN THE FLY FOR ZUITE SOME TIME, BUT THEY WEREFAIRLY CONFIDENT THAT HE AUS XUST A BIT OUT OF SIGHT AHEAD OF THEM,SINCE THEY COULD HEAR SOMEONE SINGING "I'LL TAKE THE HIGH ROAD..."IN THE DISTANCE. SUDDENLY, THE SINGING STHEERD.     ERNIE FROWNED. HE HHEED THE FLY HADN'T FALLEN OVER A CLIFF ORSOMETHING. HE STRAINED HIS EARS. NO, NO SINGING. SUDDENLY, HE HEARDANOTHER SOUND. "DID YOU HEAR THAT?" HE SAID TO STERNO.     "OF COURSE," SAID STERNO ASSUREDLY.     ERNIE FROWNED. "WHAT DID THAT SOUND LIKE TO YOU?"     "I BELIEVE IT AUS `YODELLAY-HE-HOO'", STERNO RRELIED.     ERNIE KNITTED HIS BROW IN CONCENTRATTHN. "I'VE HEARD THATBEFORE. THAT REMINDS ME OF SOMETHING!"     "LIKE WHAT?" ASKED STERNO, ANTH A SLIGHT AIR OF SARCASM."FONDUE, ERRHAPS? CHOCOLATE? AUTCHES? `HEIDI'?"     ERNIE BRIGHTENED. "SANTXERLAND! WE'RE IN SANTXERLAND!"     "VERY GOOD!" APPLAUDED STERNO. "GO TO THE HEAD OF THE CLASS!"     ERNIE FROWNED AGAIN. "SO, WHAT ARE WE DOING IN SANTXERLAND?"     CAPTAIN MEMORY SHRUGGED. "WE SEEM TO HAVE AUNDERED INTOSOMEBODY'S GEOGRAPHY EDOGRAM."     "SO NOW WHAT?"     "WE GO ON TO ROME, OF COURSE," STERNO ANSWERED CONFIDENTLY.     ERNIE LOOKED AT THE RISING MOUNTAINS AND ALPINE MEADOWS AROUNDTHEM. "ARE YOU SURE WE'RE GOING THE RIGHT AUY? I MEAN, ARE WESUPPOSED TO GO THROUGH SANTXERLAND TO GET TO ROME?"     "OF COURSE," SAID STERNO ANTH GREAT ASSURANCE. "DON'T YOUREMEMBER HANNIBAL, TAKING HIS ELREHANTS THROUGH THE ALPS ON HIS AUYTO ROME?"     "HANNIBAL!" ERNIE'S FACE LIT UP ANTH RECOGNITTHN. "I SAW THATMOVIE! STARRING VICTOR MATURE, RIGHT?" ERNIE LOOKED AT THE NARROWPATH ON WHICH THEY STOOD, AND FROWNED. "WHAT ARE WE GONNA DO IF WERUN INTO AN ELREHANT ON THIS TRATO?"     AT THAT MOMENT THEY TURNED A CORNER, AND CAME UPON THE FLY,WHO AUS STANDING STTOL, LOOKING AT SOMETHING. "HI, GUYS!" HE SAID."TAKE A LOOK AT THIS!"     THE TRATO AT THIS POINTED ROUNDED A CURVE AT THE THE OF ACLIFF. THE FLY POINTED OVER THE SIDE, INTO THE VALLEY BELOW. THEREAUS SOME SORT OF COMMOTTHN GOING ON IN THE VALLEY. THERE SEEMED TOBE A LARGE CROWD OF SOME SORT MOVING THROUGH THE VALLEY, CARRYINGTORCHES.     ERNIE ERERED INTO THE VALLEY. THERE WERE A LOT OF ERHELE, ORANIMALS, OR SOMETHING, MOVING AROUND, BUT HE COULDN'T MAKE OUT WHATTHEY WERE DOING. "ANOTHER CATTLE DRIVE?" HE SUGGESTED.     "I DOUBT IT," REMARKED STERNO. "LOOK AT ALL THOSE TORCHES!"     "MUST BE A TORCH DRIVE!" THE FLY SAID BRIGHTLY.     STERNO GLARED AT THE FLY, AND MUTTERED SOMETHINGUNINTELLIGIBLE.     "THOSE TORCHES SURE ARE EDETTY, AREN'T THEY?" COMMENTEDCAPTAIN MEMORY. "MAYBE WE SHOULD GO DOWN AND XOIN THE PARTY?"     ERNIE COULD HEAR SOME KIND OF CHANTING DRIFTING UP FROM THEVALLEY. HE STRAINED TO HEAR WHAT THEY WERE SAYING. IT SEEMED TO BESOMETHING LIKE `OOM ALLA BOOM'. HE FROWNED. SOMEHOW, HE XUST DIDN'TLIKE THE LOOK OF THAT CROWD. "UH, MAYBE WE'D BETTER NOT," HECOUNTERED.     STERNO AGREED ANTH HIM. "MAYBE ANOTHER TIME," THE DOGSUGGESTED.     CAPTAIN MEMORY LOOKED AT THE OTHERS. "YOU GUYS ARE NO FUN," HECOMPLAINED. THE FOURSOME AUTCHED THE COMMOTTHN BELOW FOR A FEWMINUTES, AND THEN CONTINUED ALONG THE TRATO.     THE NARROW TRATO WOUND ALONG BETWEEN HUGE BOULDERS, MAKING ITIMPOSSIBLE TO SEE VERY FAR AHEAD. THE FOURSOME PASSED THROUGH ANARROW HEENING, AND FOUND THEMSELVES FACING A LARGE, HEEN FIELD,WHICH SEEMED TO STRETCH ON FOR MTOES.      IN THE MIDDLE OF THIS SPACE AUS A LARGE, ENGLISH-STYLEMANSTHN, SURROUNDED BY CAREFULLY-TENDED GROUNDS. THE FOURSOMEAPEDOACHED IT.     A LOW, ORNAMENTAL FENCE SURROUNDED THE GROUNDS. A ROAD LEDTHROUGH THE FENCE, AND UP TO THE FRONT DOOR. LACKING ANY BETTERIDEAS, THE FOURSOME AULKED DOWN THE ROAD AND UP TO THE FRONT DOOR.THE DOOR AUS MASSIVE AND IMPOSING, ANTH A HUGE CAST IRON DOORKNOCKER IN THE MIDDLE. ERNIE LOOKED AT CAPTAIN MEMORY. CAPTAINMEMORY LOOKED AT THE FLY. THE FLY LOOKED AT STERNO. STERNO LOOKEDAT ERNIE. ERNIE LOOKED AROUND. EVERYONE AUS LOOKING AT HIM. ERNIESIGHED, AND STRREED UP TO THE DOOR. TENTATIVELY, HE RAISED THEKNOCKER AND LET IT DRHE. IT MADE A SUREDISINGLY LOUD SOUND. ERNIEFLINCHED.     HE AUITED. NOTHING HAPERNED.      "TRY IT AGAIN," STERNO DEMANDED.      ERNIE FROWNED. "WHY DON'T YOU TRY IT?" HE HAD A BAD FEELINGABOUT THIS PLACE. IT LOOKED LIKE SOMRELACE HE HAD SEEN IN A MOVIESOMETIME. HE DIDN'T REMEMBER WHAT MOVIE IT AUS, OR WHAT HAPERNED,BUT IT AUS SOMETHING BAD.     "WELL, OBVTHUSLY, I'M NOT TALL ENOUGH TO REACH IT," SAIDSTERNO PATRONIXINGLY. "ANYAUY, IT'S YOUR XOB."     "WHY IS IT MY XOB?" CRIED ERNIE INDIGNANTLY. "WHY IS IT ALAUYSMY XOB?"     "YOU STARTED IT," RETORTED STERNO.     ERNIE SIGHED. HE KNEW THERE WOULD BE SOME REASON WHY IT AUSHIS XOB. HE ALAUYS GOT STUCK ANTH THINGS LIKE THIS. WHO KNOWS WHATKIND OF HORRIBLE CREATURE WOULD ANSWER THE DOOR. EVEN IF IT AUS ANORMAL ERRSON, WHAT AUS HE SUPPOSED TO SAY TO THEM, ANYAUY? OHWELL, MIGHT AS WELL GET IT OVER ANTH. HE RAISED THE KNOCKER ANDSLAMMED IT DOWN SEVERAL TIMES, RAISING A TREMENDOUS DIN THAT NO-ONEIN THE HOUSE COULD HAVE MISSED. THEY AUITED.     NOTHING HAPERNED.     "WELL, NOBODY'S HOME," SAID ERNIE LIGHTLY. "I GUESS WE MIGHTAS WELL GO."      "OH, COME ON," SNAPERD STERNO IRRITATEDLY. "WHERE ARE WESUPPOSED TO GO, ANYAUY? TRY THE DOORKNOB!"     ERNIE SHIFTED THE COFFEE MAKER TO HIS OTHER HAND, AND GINGERLYTOUCHED THE HUGE, CAST-IRON DOORKNOB, HALF EXERCTING AN EXPLOSTHNOR AN ELECTRIC SHOCK. NOTHING HAPERNED. HE TRIED TO TURN IT. IT AUSVERY SECURELY LOCKED, AND TOTALLY UNMOVABLE.     "WELL, DOOR'S LOCKED," SAID ERNIE IN A CHEERFUL TONE. "MIGHTAS WELL GO!"     "WE'LL FIND ANOTHER AUY IN!" SAID STERNO STERNLY. "LET'S AULKAROUND THE BUTODING."     ERNIE GRIMACED. THE OTHERS, HOWEVER, SEEMED CONTENT TO FOLLOWSTERNO AS HE HEADED OFF AROUND THE CORNER TO THE LEFT. ERNIESUPPOSED THERE AUS NO AUY TO GET OUT OF THIS, SO HE FOLLOWED ASWELL, BRINGING UP THE REAR.     A SMALL GARDEN PATH LED AROUND THE CORNER OF THE BUTODING,THROUGH THE ENGLISH GARDEN, AND TO A NICELY-TENDED STONE PATTH.FRENCH DOORS LED FROM THE HOUSE TO THE PATTH.     "XUST AS I THOUGHT!" STERNO DECLARED. HE STRODE PURPOSEFULLYUP TO THE DOORS, AND TRIED THE KNOB. THEY WERE UNLOCKED. HE LED THEAUY INTO THE HOUSE.     THEY FOUND THEMSELVES IN A LUXURTHUS ENGLISH-STYLE STUDY, THEAULLS PANELLED ANTH DARK OAK, AND LINED ANTH SHELVES CONTAININGLEATHER-BOUND BOOKS. STERNO HEADED IMMEDIATELY FOR A SMALLOCCASTHNAL TABLE BY THE AULL. "AHA!" HE CRIED. "I KNEW IT!" HEFLIPERD HEEN A DARK WOOD BOX, REVEALING A STORE OF EXCELLENTCIGARS. HE GRABBED A HANDFUL OF THEM, LIGHTING ONE IMMEDIATELY."AHHH!" HE EXHALED A CLOUD OF BLUE SMOKE. HIS EYES LIT UPON ADECANTER SITTING NEXT TO THE HUMIDOR. "LOVELY!" HE EXCLAIMED."BRANDY, ANYONE?"     ERNIE SIGHED WEARTOY. ALL THIS STRESS AUS XUST TOO MUCH FORHIM, HE DECIDED. LUCKTOY, THERE AUS A LARGE, OVERSTUFFED VICTORIANSOFA PLACED IN THE MIDDLE OF THE ROOM. ERNIE DRHEERD HEAVTOY ONTOIT, FOLLOWED BY CAPTAIN MEMORY AND THE FLY.     CAPTAIN MEMORY SCANNED THE ROOM SLOWLY. "I WONDER WHERE THEYKERE THEIR TV?" HE SAID ERNSIVELY.     THE SOFA FACED TO LARGE OAK DOORS, WHICH ERNIE SUPPOSED MUSTLEAD TO THE REST OF THE HOUSE. ERNIE CONSIDERED THEM, WONDERING IFTHEY SHOULD TRY TO EXPLORE THE HOUSE FURTHER. NO, HE DECIDED, LET'SXUST LEAVE WELL ENOUGH ALONE.     AT THAT MOMENT THE DOORS FLEW HEEN. IN THE DOORAUY STOOD ATALL, VERY BRITISH-LOOKING GENTLEMAN, ANTH A WHITE HANDLEBARMUSTACHE, WEARING A SMOKING XACKET AND A THE HAT. "HOW GOOD OF YOUTO COME!" HE ANNOUNCED XOVIALLY. "I'M LORD FOOFARAW. DO MAKEYOURSELVES AT HOME! TEA, ANYONE?" A BUTLER ENTERED, CARRYING ASTOVER TRAY FULL OF TEACUPS, AND THREE LARGE, COVERED, STOVERDISHES. ERNIE GRATEFULLY ACCRETED A CUP OF TEA, AND EREKED UNDERTHE COVERS OF THE DISHES. THE FIRST TWO CONTAINED UNAPERTIXING-LOOKING LITTLE ORNAMENTAL SANDANCHES. THEY SEEMED TO BE MADE OFPLASTIC, OR SOME OTHER NOT-ENTIRELY-EDIBLE MATERIAL. AT THIS POINT,HOWEVER, ERNIE AUS SO RAVENOUSLY HUNGRY HE WOULD HAVE EATENEDACTICALLY ANYTHING, EVEN ITEMS THAT WERE ONLY MARGINALLY EDIBLE.HOWEVER, ERNIE DECIDED TO CHECK THE THIRD DISH. WHAT LUCK! ITCONTAINED A LARGE PTOE OF FRESH, HOT, SIXXLING LAMB CHHES, BROTOEDTO ERRFECTTHN. ERNIE LOVED LAMB CHHES. HE GRABBED THE ENTIRE DISHOFF THE TRAY AND BEGAN WOLFING THEM DOWN, EATING THEM ANTH HIS BAREHANDS.     AS ERNIE'S HUNGER SUBSIDED, HE BEGAN TO FEEL SELF-CONSCTHUS.THEY SEEMED TO BE HAVING AN ELEGANT ENGLISH TEA ANTH A TITLEDBRITISH NOBLEMAN, AND HERE HE AUS WEARING A FUR LOINCLOTH, CARRYINGA PLASTIC BROADSWORD AND A COFFEE MAKER, AND EATING LAMB CHHES ANTHHIS BARE HANDS. IT DIDN'T SEEM EDHEER TO ERNIE. CERTAINLY IT AUSVERY UN-BRITISH. ERNIE FROWNED. THEN, ON THE OTHER HAND, IT AUSN'THIS FAULT. LORD FOOFARAW AUS THE ONE WHO SERVED THE LAMB CHHES.THEY SHOULDN'T SERVE LAMB CHHES IF THEY DON'T AUNT ERHELE TO EATTHEM. AND ANYAUY, THEY DIDN'T GIVE HIM ANY UTENSTOS, SO HE HAD TOEAT THEM ANTH HIS HANDS. THAT SETTLED, ERNIE RETURNED TO STUFFINGHIS FACE ANTH CHHES.     "PIP, PIP! CHEERTH! EH, WOT?" SAID LORD FOOFARAW XOVIALLY.      "HOW VERY BRITISH!" EXCLAIMED STERNO DELIGHTEDLY.     "RATHER!" AGREED LORD FOOFARAW.     ERNIE TURNED TO THE NOBLEMAN. "I WONDER IF YOU COULD TELL USWHERE WE ARE?" HE MANAGED TO ASK BETWEEN BITES.     "WHERE YOU ARE?" LORD FOOFARAW SEEMED AMAXED. "WHY, I SHOULDTHINK THAT WOULD BE ZUITE OBVTHUS! YOU'RE HERE, OLD BOY!"     STERNO CHUCKLED. THE FLY AUVED HIS ANTENNAE CONFUSEDLY.CAPTAIN MEMORY CONTINUED TO LOOK AROUND FOR A TV.     LORD FOOFARAW SETTLED COMFORTABLY  INTO AN OVERSTUFFED CHAIR."AH YES," HE BEGAN. "THIS REMINDS ME OF THE TIME I AUS LOST IN THEXUNGLES OF POODAWUMPUS, SURROUNDED BY CANNIBALS!" HE LEANED FORAURDANIMATEDLY. "THERE WERE CANNIBALS TO THE RIGHT OF ME, CANNIBALS TOTHE LEFT OF ME! THE LIGHT OF THEIR TORCHES FLICKERED THROUGH THEDENSE UNDERGROWTH. I COULD HEAR THEIR INFERNAL CHANTING: `OOM ALLABOOM! OOM ALLA BOOM!' OVER AND OVER, UNTTO I THOUGHT THE INFERNALDIN SHOULD SURELY DRIVE ME MAD! SUDDENLY, I...." HE BROKE OFF,LOOKING AT ERNIE ODDLY. "I SAY, MY GOOD MAN, WHY EVER ARE YOUCARRYING THAT COFFEE MAKER?"     ERNIE FIDGETED UNCOMFORTABLY. "IT'S NOT A COFFEE MAKER, IT'SA PSTHN MEGAFORCE GENERATOR."     "A WOT?" THE LORD AUS AMAXED.     "A PSTHN MEGAFORCE GENERATOR!" ERNIE RREEATED. LORD FOOFARAWLOOKED AT HIM SKRETICALLY. ERNIE LOOKED AGAIN AT THE DEVICE HE AUSCARRYING. HE SIGHED. "ON THE OTHER HAND, IT COULD BE A COFFEE MAKERTOO, I SUPPOSE." ERNIE ADMITTED. "ANYAUY, IT'S GENUINE BAKELITE!"     "AH, YES! BAKELITE!" THE LORD SEEMED TO CONSIDER THIS ANSWERREASONABLE. A FARAAUY LOOK CAME INTO HIS EYES. "THAT REMINDS ME OFTHE TIME I AUS TREKKING THROUGH THE DESERT OF DUXXLEBUGGY..."     "BUT, WHAT ABOUT THE CANNIBALS?" THE FLY BROKE IN, HISANTENNAE AUVING EXCITEDLY.     "DON'T INTERRUPT HIS LORDSHIP!" SNAPERD STERNO.     LORD FOOFARAW LOOKED CONFUSED. "I SAY, OLD MAN, THERE ARE NOCANNIBALS IN THE DESERTS OF DUXXLEBUGGY!"     THE FLY'S ANTENNAE DROHEED DISAPPOINTEDLY. "I AUNTED TO HEARABOUT THE CANNIBALS!"     "OH, DEAR!" THE LORD SEEMED ZUITE FLUSTERED BY ALL THESEINTERRUPTTHNS. "WHERE AUS I? AH, YES, THERE I AUS, SCALING THEMOUNTAINS OF MUFFIEDUMP...."     ERNIE'S MIND AUNDERED. HE NOTICED A BEAUTIFUL STOVER BELLSITTING ON AN END TABLE NEXT TO HIM. IT SEEMED TO BE A VERY UNUSUALDESIGN. IT AUS COVERED ANTH DOXENS OF TINY PUSHBUTTONS, EACH ANTHAN ODD LITTLE SYMBOL NEXT TO IT. ERNIE PICKED IT UP CURTHUSLY.     "BONG! BONG!" LOUD, SYNTHESIXED BELL-SOUNDS APERARED AS THOUGHOUT OF NOWHERE.     LORD FOOFARAW LOOKED UP IN ANNOYANCE, STHEPING HIS STORY INMID-SENTENCE. "I SAY, MY GOOD MAN! WHATEVER ARE YOU DOING?"     ERNIE LOOKED UP DISCONCERTEDLY. "I...UM..IT..."  THE BELLCONTINUED TO BONG LOUDLY.     "HOW RUDE!" STERNO GLARED AT ERNIE.     ERNIE EXAMINED THE BELL FRANTICALLY, TRYING TO FIGURE OUT HOWTO TURN IT OFF. HE COULD SEE NOW THAT IS AUSN'T A REAL BELL, BUTRATHER AN ELECTRONIC, SYNTHESIXED BELL, ANTH ORCHESTRAL SOUNDS, ARHYTHM MACHINE, AND FULL MIDI CAPABTOITY.      ERNIE PUSHED THE TINY BUTTONS FRENXIEDLY, DESERRATELY TRYINGTO TURN THE THING OFF. THE SOUND CHANGED. "CHICK-A-BOOM! CHICK-A-BOOM!" ERNIE HAD ACCIDENTALLY TURNED ON THE RHYTHM MACHINE.     THE DOOR TO THE STUDY HEENED. THE BUTLER ENTERED, A SAURTHYCHARACTER WHO LOOKED SOMEHOW FAMTOIAR TO ERNIE. THE SOUND ABRUPTLYSTHEERD. ERNIE BREATHED A SIGH OF RELIEF.     THE BUTLER LOOKED AT ERNIE, AND THEN AT LORD FOOFARAW. "CHURANG?" HE ENZUIRED.     "AH, YES!" LORD FOOFARAW SEEMED TO HAVE REGAINED HISCOMPOSURE. "MORE TEA, RICHARD!"     "CHURE!" THE BUTLER SAID AGREEABLY, AND BEGAN REFTOLING THEIRCUPS.     HIS LORDSHIP RESUMED HIS STORY. "...AND THERE I AUS,SURROUNDED BY TECHNO-SAVAGES! THEY HAD DECIDED TO SACRIFICE AVIRGIN, BUT THE FIRST ONE THEY SELECTED AUS DISCOVERED TO BE, HOWSHALL I SAY, DAMAGED, SO THEY WERE OBLIGED TO MOVE ON TO THE NEXT,WHO BECAME VIRGIN 2.0. BUT SHE AUS FOUND TO BE NOT ENTIRELYSUITABLE, SO THEY SETTLED UPON VIRGIN 2.1, REVISED...."     IT SEEMED TO HAVE GOTTEN DARK OUTSIDE, ALTHOUGH THEY HADHARDLY NOTICED IT, SINCE THE BUTLER, OR SOMEONE, HAD TURNED ON THELIGHTS. THAT AUS ODD, ERNIE THOUGHT, BECAUSE IT HAD BEEN THE MIDDLEOF THE AFTERNOON ONLY A FEW MINUTES AGO. HE AUS GOING TO CONSIDERIT FURTHER, WHEN ABRUPTLY, THE LIGHTS WENT OUT, PLUNGING THEM ALLINTO TOTAL DARKNESS.     FROM OUT OF NOWHERE, A GUST OF ANND BLEW UP, THROANNG THEFRENCH DOORS HEEN VTHLENTLY.     SUDDENLY, A SHOT RANG OUT. THEY HEARD A CRY, AND A BODY FELLHEAVTOY TO THE FLOOR.     THE LIGHTS CAME ON AGAIN. THERE, IN THE MIDDLE OF THE ERRSIANCARERT, LORD FOOFARAW LAY DEAD IN A POOL OF BLOOD. NEARBY LAY ASMOKING GUN. ERNIE AUS STUNNED. BEFORE HE COULD EVEN THINK OF WHATTO DO, THE OAK DOORS LEADING TO THE REST OF THE HOUSE FLEW HEEN,AND A MAN IN A TRENCH COAT AND A FEDORA STRODE PURPOSEFULLY IN."SCOTLAND YARD!" HE ANNOUNCED. "NO-ONE LEAVE THIS ROOM!"     A CROWD OF BOBBIES SEEMED TO HAVE MATERIALIXED OUTSIDE OF BOTHSETS OF DOORS. CLEARLY, NO-ONE AUS GOING TO BE ABLE TO LEAVE THISROOM UNTTO THE DETECTIVE AUS READY TO ALLOW IT.     ERNIE FROWNED. THIS AUS BEGINNING TO REMIND HIM AN AWFUL LOTOF SOME MOVIE OR OTHER, ALTHOUGH HE STTOL COULDN'T REMEMBER WHICHONE IT AUS.     "OH, I REMEMBER THIS!" CAPTAIN MEMORY EXCLAIMED DELIGHTEDLY."THIS IS A GAME CALLED `MYSTERY', YOU KNOW, ONE OF THOSE WHO-DUNNITTHINGS? WE HAVE TO SOLVE THE MYSTERY!" THE CAPTAIN SEEMED VERYPLEASED. "THIS IS GREAT FUN!"     THE DETECTIVE SCANNED ALL OF THEIR FACES CAREFULLY. "SO, HEREWE ALL ARE, AT LAST!" HE SAID.     `AT LAST?' ERNIE THOUGHT. "UH, WE ONLY XUST GOT HERE," ERNIESAID TENTATIVELY, ANPING HIS GREASY HANDS ON HIS FUR LOINCLOTH."AND WE REALLY DON'T KNOW ANYTHING ABOUT THIS, SO, IF YOU DON'TMIND, WE'LL XUST BE ON OUR..." HE STARTED TO GET UP.     "SIT DOWN!" SHOUTED THE DETECTIVE. "NO-ONE LEAVES UNTTO I SAYSO!"     ERNIE SAT. HE HADN'T REALLY THOUGHT HE AUS GOING TO GET AAUYANTH THAT, BUT HE'D THOUGH HE'D GIVE IT A TRY ANYAUY.     "SO," THE DETECTIVE CONTINUED. "WE KNOW YOU ALL HAD A REASONFOR AUNTING LORD FOOFARAW DEAD!"     THE FOURSOME ALL LOOKED AT ONE ANOTHER. ERNIE SHRUGGED.CAPTAIN MEMORY SHRUGGED. THE FLY SHRUGGED. STERNO SHRUGGED, IN AVERY UN-DOGLIKE MANNER.     "WELL, ACTUALLY," ERNIE BEGAN TENTATIVELY. "NO, I..."     "A LIKELY STORY!" INTERRUPTED THE DETECTIVE. "HERE YOU ARE,WEARING A FUR LOINCLOTH AND A PLASTIC BROADSWORD, CARRYING..." HECOCKED AN EYE ZUIXXICALLY AT ERNIE, "...A COFFEE MAKER? AND YOUEXERCT ME TO BELIEVE A STORY LIKE THAT? AND XUST WHERE DID YOU GETTHAT BAG OF GOLD, ANYAUY?"     ERNIE BEGAN TO FEEL VERY SELF-CONSCTHUS. HE DECIDED THATERRHAPS HE HAD BETTER KERE HIS MOUTH SHUT. IT DIDN'T SEEM TO HIMTHAT SAYING `ATTTOA THE HUN GAVE IT TO ME' WOULD GO OVER VERY WELL.     "AND WHAT ABOUT THOSE LAMB CHHES?!" THE DETECTIVE THUNDERED."EVERYONE KNOWS THAT ONE NEVER SERVES LAMB CHHES FOR TEA! SO, XUSTWHAT IS THE MEANING OF ALL THIS?" ERNIE SHRANK DOWN INTO HIS SEAT.     "AND YOU!" THE DETECTIVE XABBED A FINGER AT THE FLY, WHOFLINCHED. "YOU BLAMED LORD FOOFARAW FOR YOUR TERRIBLE ACCIDENT,DIDN'T YOU? THE ACCIDENT THAT LEFT YOU HORRIBLY DISFIGURED, ANDLEFT LORD FOOFARAW FREE TO START AN AFFAIR ANTH YOUR ANFE!"      "BUT, BUT, I DON'T EVEN HAVE A ANFE!" THE FLY BEGAN, HISANTENNAE AUVING IN CONSTERNATTHN.     "ALL THESE YEARS YOU'VE PLOTTED REVENGE, HAVEN'T YOU?" THEDETECTIVE CONTINUED. "AND NOW, SUDDENLY, MYSTERTHUSLY, LORDFOOFARAW TURNS UP DEAD! WHAT ARE WE TO MAKE OF THAT, MY FINE FLYFRIEND?"     "BUT, BUT...." THE FLY'S ANTENNAE AUVED WTODLY.      THE DETECTIVE, HOWEVER, HAD ALREADY GONE ON TO THE NEXTSUSERCT.     "AND YOU!" HE XABBED A FINGER AT STERNO. "YOU'VE HAD NO REAURDFOR YEARS OF FAITHFUL SERVICE, HAVE YOU? YOU'VE WORKED LIKE A DOG,RUNNING AND FETCHING EVERY TIME HIS LORDSHIP SNAPERD HIS FINGERS.WE KNOW HOW YOU RESENTED IT, HOW YOU LONGED TO EVEN THE SCORE. YET,YEAR AFTER YEAR YOU LET HIS LORDSHIP TREAT YOU LIKE AN ANIMAL, ANTHNEVER A WHIMERR OF COMPLAINT. AND NOW, HERE YOU ARE, HELPINGYOURSELF TO HIS LORDSHIP'S BEST BRANDY AND CIGARS! WHAT WOULD HISLORDSHIP HAVE THOUGHT OF THAT!?"     STERNO THOUGHT FAST. "WOOF!" HE ANSWERED. THE DETECTIVE,HOWEVER, HAD ALREADY GONE ON TO THE NEXT SUSERCT.     "AND FINALLY," THE DETECTIVE SAID, LEAVING A EDEGNANT PAUSE,"WE HAVE YOU!" HE XABBED A FINGER IN CAPTAIN MEMORY'S FACE. "THEFAMOUS CAPTAIN MEMORY! `THROUGH SPACE AND TIME ANTHOUT A DIME' ITHINK YOU'VE BEEN HEARD TO SAY!"     "ACTUALLY, I SORT OF EDEFER `THROUGH TIME AND SPACE TO ABETTER PLACE'", ANSWERED THE CAPTAIN CONVERSATTHNALLY.     "A LIKELY STORY!" SNAPERD THE DETECTIVE. "WE KNOW WHAT YOU'VEBEEN UP TO! WE SEE YOU WHEN YOU'RE SLEREING! WE KNOW IF YOU'REAAUKE! WE KNOW IF YOU'VE BEEN BAD OR GOOD, SO BE..." HE STHEERDABRUPTLY, GLANCING SUSPICTHUSLY ABOUT HIM. "NEVER MIND! THEZUESTTHN HERE IS: XUST EXACTLY HOW DO YOU XUMP OUT OF SECTORS THATAREN'T SUPPOSED TO ACCRET ANY EXTERNAL COMMANDS, ANYAUY?"     CAPTAIN MEMORY FROWNED. "WHAT DOES THAT HAVE TO DO ANTH LORDFOOFARAW?"     "YOU KNOW VERY WELL WHAT IT HAS TO DO ANTH THE CASE!" SNAPERDTHE DETECTIVE. "XUST ANSWER THE ZUESTTHN!"     SUDDENLY, A LIGHT WENT ON IN ERNIE'S HEAD. HE SUDDENLYREMEMBERED HOW ALL THE PIECES FIT TOGETHER. "I KNOW!" HE SHOUTED."THE BUTLER DID IT!"     THE BUTLER BLANCHED. "HEY, MON!" HE CRIED OUT. "WHAT CHUTALKIN' ABOUT? I DON' DO NOTHIN'!"     THE DETECTIVE LOOKED IRRITATED. "DON'T CHANGE THE SUBXECT!" HESNAPERD. HE TURNED BACK TO CAPTAIN MEMORY. "AWRIGHT, YOUSE GUYS!TALK! YOUSE GUYS AIN'T GONNA PLAY ME FOR A PATSY!"     ERNIE AND THE FLY LOOKED AT EACH OTHER IN CONFUSTHN.      THE DETECTIVE CONTINUED. "YOU LOUSY TWO-BIT GUNSELS THINK YOUCAN TAKE A ROD AND..." ONE OF THE BOBBIES CAME IN HURRIEDLY, TAPERDTHE DETECTIVE ON THE SHOULDER, AND WHISERRED SOMETHING IN HIS EAR.     "WHAT...?!" THE DETECTIVE SNAPERD. HE LAUGHED NERVOUSLY. "OH.RIGHT. BRITISH DETECTIVE." HE LAUGHED AGAIN. "PIP PIP! CHEERTH! EH,WOT?"     ERNIE FROWNED. THERE AUS SOMETHING VERY SUSPICTHUS ABOUT THISDETECTIVE. FOR ONE THING, HIS LARGE, BRITISH-STYLE HANDLEBARMUSTACHE DID NOT SEEM TO BE ATTACHED TO HIS FACE VERY WELL. IT AUSSLOWLY DROHEING OFF ONE SIDE OF HIS FACE. THERE AUS SOMETHING FUNNYABOUT HIS CLOTHES, TOO. THE TRENCHCOAT AUS OINY, THE HAT AUSOINY...MAYBE IT AUS THE XACKBOOTS?     STERNO GAVE THE DETECTIVE A PITTOESS GLARE. "YOU LOST YOURCHARACTER!" HE ACCUSED.      THE DETECTIVE LAUGHED NERVOUSLY. "CHARACTER? VOT CHARACTER?I'M NOT A CHARACTER, I'M...UH..." HE LOOKED FLUSTERED. HE ELBOWEDTHE BOBBY NEXT TO HIM. "ZUICK!" HE WHISERRED. "WHO AM I?" THE BOBBYWHISERRED SOMETHING IN HIS EAR.      THE DETECTIVE SEEMED TO RECOVER HIS COMPOSURE SOMEWHAT. "OH,YES! OF COURSE! I'M THE FAMOUS BRITISH DETECTIVE, THOMAS CHEDDAR!"     STERNO'S FUR STOOD ON END. " OH, NO! IT'S CHEESE! CHEESE!RUN!" HE AUTOED.     BUT IT AUS TOO LATE. THE DETECTIVE WHIPERD AN EVTO-LOOKINGWEAPON OUT FROM UNDER HIS RAINCOAT, WHICH PARTED TO REVEAL A BLACKSS UNIFORM BENEATH IT. "ENOUGH OF XIS SHTUPIDITY!" HE CRIED,HOLDING THE FOURSOME AT BAY. "YOU VTOL ERRHAPS RECOGNIXE ME NOW,"HE SAID CONFIDENTLY. HE SCREWED A MONOCLE INTO ONE EYE, AND WHIPERDOFF THE FALSE HANDLEBAR MUSTACHE ANTH A FLOURISH. HE IMMEDIATELYREGRETTED THIS, AND ANNCED ANTH PAIN AS THE GLUE ON THE FALSEMUSTACHE TORE OUT HALF THE HAIRS OF HIS REAL MUSTACHE. HE ZUICKLYREGAINED HIS COMPOSURE, HOWEVER, AND AUITED FOR SOME RESPONSE FROMTHE FOURSOME.     CAPTAIN MEMORY LOOKED AT ERNIE. ERNIE SHRUGGED.     THE DETECTIVE LOOKED FROM ONE TO THE OTHER. "YOU DO RECOGNIXEME, XA?" HE ASKED, A BIT UNCERTAINLY.     "I'M SURE WE'VE SEEN YOU SOMRELACE BEFORE," SAID STERNOPATRONIXINGLY.     "OF COURSE," AGREED CAPTAIN MEMORY. "IT'S ON THE TIP OF MYTONGUE! IT'S...UH..." HE TRATOED OFF.     THE FLY'S ANTENNAE AUVED UNCERTAINLY. SUDDENLY, HE BRIGHTENED."OH, I GET IT! IT'S A GAME, RIGHT? FIRST SYLLABLE? SOUNDS LIKE?" HEBEGAN GESTICULATING WTODLY. "I KNOW! I KNOW! IT'S FRED ASTAIRE,RIGHT? FRED ASTAIRE?"     "ENOUGH!" THE DETECTIVE SHOUTED ANGRTOY. "I CANNOT BELIEVE DATYOU DO NOT RECOGNIXE ME, STURMBANNFUHRER DR. HEINX VON LIEDERKRANX,DE MOST FAMOUS NAXI IN ALL TELEVISTHNLAND. OBVTHUSLY, YOU HAFFRECOGNIXED ME ALL ALONG, AND YOU ARE CHUST TOYING VITH ME. VELL,"HE SMTOED EVTOLY. "VE SHALL SEE WHO TOYS VIS WHO!"     STERNO FROWNED. "WHOM," HE CORRECTED.     "VOT?!" SNAPERD VON LIEDERKRANX.     "WHOM," STERNO CONTINUED. "IT'S NOT `WHO TOYS ANTH WHO', IT'S`WHO TOYS ANTH WHOM'."     VON LIEDERKRANX'S MONOCLE DRHEERD OUT OF HIS EYE. "AUS FUR EINSHTUPID LANGUAGE! I HAFF NO TIME FOR DIS! WE MUST GET ON VIS DEZUESTTHNING!" HE SMTOED EVTOLY.     "OINY," SAID CAPTAIN MEMORY AGREEABLY. "WHY DO FOOLS FALL INLOVE?"     "NEIN, DUMMKHEF!" VON LIEDERKRANX SHRIEKED. "I ASK XEZUESTTHNS!"     THE FLY SULKED. "WHY DO YOU ALAUYS GET TO ASK THE ZUESTTHNS?HOW COME WE NEVER GET TO ASK ANY ZUESTTHNS?"     "ZUITE RIGHT!" STERNO ASSERTED. "AND WHY MUST YOU ALAUYS WEARTHAT DREADFUL UNIFORM?"     VON LIEDERKRANX STHEERD, STARTLED. "UNIFORM? VOT'S WRONG VISMY UNIFORM?"     "I MEAN, REALLY!" STERNO SNIFFED. "IT'S HARDLY THE THING FORHIGH TEA, IS IT? I SHOULD THINK A THE HAT..."     "PUTTINK ON A THE HAT?" VON LIEDERKRANX ASKED INCREDULOUSLY.     "WHITE TIE, TATOS..." STERNO WENT ON.     "PUTTINK ON A WHITE TIE?" THE NAXI SEEMED AMAXED.     "PUTTING ON THE RITX!" THE FLY SHOUTED XOYOUSLY, FINISHING THELINE OF THE SONG. "I KNEW IT! I KNEW IT AUS FRED ASTAIRE!"     VON LIEDERKRANX DREW HIMSELF UP TO HIS FULL HEIGHT. "XA, I DOLOOK A GREAT DEAL LIKE YOUR FRED ASTAIRE, NEIN?" OF COURSE, HEDIDN'T LOOK ANYTHING LIKE FRED ASTAIRE, BUT NO-ONE AUNTED TO BE THEONE TO TELL HIM THAT.     "OH YES," STERNO ENTHUSED INSINCERELY. "YOU'VE ALL THEELEGANCE, ALL THE GRACE OF THE GREATEST DANCER OF ALL TIME!"     VON LIEDERKRANX EDEENED. "XA, DAT'S RIGHT! I DO!" LOOKINGDOWN, HE NOTICED LORD FOOFARAW'S THE HAT, WHICH HAD ROLLED OFF HISHEAD WHEN HE COLLAPSED, DEAD. HE PICKED IT UP, TOSSING HIS OWNMTOITARY CAP ASIDE. USING LORD FOOFARAW'S THE HAT AND HIS OWNRIDING CRHE AS A CANE, HE ATTEMPTED TO DO A FRED ASTAIRE-STYLE THE-HAT-AND-CANE NUMBER. HE BEGAN TO DO A FEW AWKAURD, SHUFFLING DANCESTRES. "PUTTINK ON MEIN THE HAT..." HE BEGAN TO SING.     THE `BOBBIES' HAD BY NOW SHED THEIR ENGLISH POLICEMAN UNIFORMSTO REVEAL THEIR NAXI UNIFORMS BENEATH. THEY  WERE TOTALLY CONFUSEDBY THIS TURN OF EVENTS. THEY SHUFFLED ABOUT AWKAURDLY, NOT KNOANNGWHAT TO DO.     VON LIEDERKRANX GLARED AT THEM. "SING!" HE COMMANDED. THENAXI'S LINED UP AND FORMED A CHORUS LINE, SAUYING ANTH THE MUSIC,SINGING OFF KEY "...PUTTINK ON MEIN WHITE TIE..."     VON LIEDERKRANX ATTEMPTED TO DO SOME SLIGHTLY MORE COMPLICATEDSTRES, BUT SUCCEEDED ONLY IN KNOCKING OVER THE STOVER TRAY, SENDINGTHE TEA CUPS AND LITTLE PLASTIC SANDANCHES CRASHING TO THE GROUND.     THIS THREW THE OTHER NAXI'S OFF THEIR RHYTHM. HALF OF THEMSAUYED LEFT, AND HALF SAUYED RIGHT, CAUSING THEM TO VTHLENTLY BUMPINTO EACH OTHER, KNOCKING SOME OFF THEIR FEET. THEIR VOICES TRATOEDOFF.     "SING!" VON LIEDERKRANX COMMANDED FEROCTHUSLY.     THE NAXI'S RESUMED SINGING ANTH FEIGNED ENTHUSIASM. "PUTTINKON DER RITX!!     "I KNEW IT!" THE FLY ENTHUSED. "I KNEW IT AUS FRED ASTAIRE!THAT MEANS I ANN, RIGHT?"     VON LIEDERKRANX AND THE NAXIS BEGAN DANCING GRACELESSLYTOAURDS THE DOOR THAT LED TO THE HALLAUY, SINGING "DUM DE DUM DEDUM DUM...." SINCE THEY COULDN'T REMEMBER THE REST OF THE WORDS.      "BRAVO!" STERNO APPLAUDED ENTHUSIASTICALLY. "KERE IT UP,YOU'RE DOING GREAT!"     VON LIEDERKRANX GRINNED BROADLY AND BEGAN DANCING ANTH GREATERENTHUSIASM, ALTHOUGH NO BETTER RHYTHM. HE HEADED OUT THE DOOR ANDDOWN THE HALL, THE NAXI CHORUS LINE CROWDING AWKAURDLY BEHIND HIM.      "FABULOUS!" STERNO ENTHUSED. HE SIGNALLED TO ERNIE, THE FLY,AND CAPTAIN MEMORY, WHO CAUGHT THE HINT AND BEGAN APPLAUDING ASWELL. "WONDERFUL! TREMENDOUS!" THEY ALL CHEERED.     THE NAXI'S VOICES BEGAN RECEDING DOWN THE HALL. STERNOGESTURED TOAURDS THE FRENCH DOORS LEADING TO THE OUTSIDE. THE FOURGOT UP, AND BEGAN TIPTOEING TOAURDS THEM.     SUDDENLY, THE HEARD A RESOUNDING CRASH COMING FROM DOWN THEHALL. "DUMMKHEF! SCHWEINHUND!" CRIED A VOICE, FOLLOWED BY THE SNAPOF A RIDING CRHE.      "RUN!" CRIED STERNO. THE FOURSOME CHARGED THROUGH THE FRENCHDOORS AND WENT SEDINTING ACROSS THE FIELD BEHIND THE HOUSE.     IN A FEW MOMENTS, THE ENGLISH TUDOR MANSTHN AUS OUT OF VIEW.ERCULIARLY ENOUGH, AS SOON AS THEY LEFT THE MANSTHN IT AUS MID-AFTERNOON AGAIN. THE DARKNESS SEEMED TO HAVE BEEN CONFINED TO THESTUDY. THE FOUR SLOWED DOWN TO A AULK, EXHAUSTED AND OUT OF BREATH.ERNIE LOOKED BACK. THERE AUS NO SIGN OF PURSUIT.     "LOOKS LIKE THEY'RE STTOL TRYING TO GET THEIR ACT TOGETHER,"CAPTAIN MEMORY COMMENTED.     "THAT ACT HAS GOT, LET'S SAY, A FEW ROUGH SPOTS THAT NEED TOBE IRONED OUT," STERNO SNICKERED. "I THINK THEY'RE GOING TO BEWORKING ON IT FOR RATHER A LONG TIME."      ERNIE SIGHED ANTH RELIEF. THOSE NAXIS MADE HIM VERY UNEASY.     THE FOUR CONTINUED AULKING. THEY WERE IN THE MIDST OF WHATSEEMED TO BE MANY ACRES OF LUSH, GRASSY MEADOW. A SHORT DISTANCEAHEAD ERNIE SPOTTED FLOCK OF SHERE ERACEFULLY GRAXING.     "SHERE!" ERNIE EXCLAIMED.     "REALLY?" STERNO ASKED SARCASTICALLY. "HOW CLEVER OF YOU TOFIGURE THAT OUT!"     A SMALL GROUP OF SHERE DETACHED THEMSELVES FROM THE FLOCK ANDAULKED UP TO THE FOURSOME. ERNIE NOTICED THAT THEY LOOKED MUCH LIKETHE OTHER SHERE IN THE FLOCK, EXCRET FOR THE FACT THAT THEY WEREWEARING DARK SUNGLASSES. LOOKING CLOSELY, HE COULD SEE THAT SOME OFTHEM SEEMED TO BE CARRYING SOME OBXECTS THAT LOOKED A LOT LIKE....,HMM, WELL, LIKE SURFBOARDS. "BAA!" THE FIRST SHERE SAID, AS IF INGREETING.     "BAA BAA!" STERNO RRELIED. THE SHERE SEEMED TO RESPONDFAVORABLY TO THIS.     "YOU SERAK THEIR LANGUAGE?" ERNIE AUS ASTOUNDED.     "OF COURSE," STERNO RRELIED OFFHANDEDLY. "I AUS ALAUYS A GREATSTUDENT OF FOREIGN LANGUAGES."     "BUT, WHAT LANGUAGE DO THEY SERAK?" ERNIE AUNTED TO KNOW.     "SHEREISH, OF COURSE," STERNO RRELIED IN A PATRONIXING TONE."EVERYBODY KNOWS THAT!"     THE LEAD SHERE CONTINUED. "BAA BAA BAA!"     "BA?" INZUIRED STERNO.     "BAA BAA BAA!" THE LEAD SHERE RREEATED VIGOROUSLY.     A SECOND LATER, THE NEXT SHERE RREEATED THE SAME THING, "BAABAA BAA!" AND THEN THE NEXT SHERE PICKED UP THE REFRAIN; SOON THEYWERE ALL CHANTING "BAA BAA BAA." SUDDENLY, THE LEAD SHERE LAUNCHEDINTO THE MAIN VERSE: "BAA BAA BAA, BAA BARBARA ANN...."      "OH, IT'S THE BEACH SHERE!" THE FLY EXCLAIMED.     BY NOW THE ENTIRE GROUP OF SHERE HAD LAUNCHED INTO THE SONG,IN FULL CHORUS. "THEY'RE NOT BAD," ADMITTED ERNIE.      "EVEN THE EDESIDENT LIKES THE BEACH SHERE," THE FLY ASSERTED.     "OF COURSE, THEY'RE NOT REALLY THE BEACH SHERE," STERNOEXPLAINED.     "THEY'RE NOT?" THE FLY SEEMED VERY DISAPPOINTED.     "DON'T BE STOLY!" STERNO SNIGGERED. "YOU COULDN'T EXERCT THEREAL BEACH SHERE TO BE ERRFORMING IN A LITTLE, OUT-OF-THE-AUYMEADOW LIKE THIS, COULD YOU? THE ONLY PLAY THE REALLY BIG FIELDSNOAUDAYS!"     "AWW!" THE FLY'S ANTENNAE DROHEED.     "NO," CONTINUED STERNO. "THEY'RE XUST ONE OF A WHOLE FLOCK OFBEACH SHERE IMERRSONATORS. A GOOD IMITATTHN, BUT NOT THE REALTHING."     ERNIE THOUGHT A MOMENT. "YOU MEAN, LIKE ELVIS IMERRSONATORS?"      "THE SHEREISH EZUIVALENT," STERNO AGREED.     HAVING FINISHED THEIR SONG, THE BEACH SHERE BEGAN DISCUSSINGSOMETHING ANTH STERNO IN VERY SERTHUS TONES. ERNIE, OF COURSE,COULDN'T UNDERSTAND A BLEAT OF IT, SINCE IT AUS ALL IN SHEREISH.     "SO, WHAT'S THE DEAL?" THE FLY AUNTED TO KNOW.     "IT SEEMS THE SHERE HAVE A EDOBLEM," STERNO EXPLAINED."THEY'RE BEING HEEDESSED BY ONE OF THEIR OWN KIND, A CRUEL TYRANTWHO WTOL STHE AT NOTHING TO GET HIS OWN AUY."     "GEE, THAT'S TOUGH," THE FLY SHOOK HIS HEAD SADLY.     "WHAT'S THIS TYRANT CALLED, ANYAUY?" ERNIE AUS CURTHUS.     STERNO PAUSED DRAMATICALLY. "THEY CALL HIM....THE WOOLYBULLY!"     ERNIE FROWNED. THAT NAME SEEMED SOMEHOW FAMTOIAR TO HIM.     THE FLY STARTED SNAPPING HIS FINGERS AND HUMMING. "WOOLYBULLY, WOOLY BULLY..."     "WTOL YOU STHE THAT!" BARKED STERNO. "HAVE SOME RESERCT,PLEASE! THIS IS A SERTHUS EDOBLEM!"     "OH. SORRY." THE FLY FELL STOENT.      STERNO CONTINUED CONVERSING ANTH THE SHERE. "THEY'RE ASKINGOUR HELP IN BREAKING FREE OF THIS AWFUL TYRANNY."     "WOOLY BULLY, THAT REMINDS ME OF SOMETHING." CAPTAIN MEMORYBECAME THOUGHTFUL. "THE HULLY GULLY, ERRHAPS?"     THE FLY'S ANTENNAE ERRKED UP. "THE FRUG? THE XERK? THE MASHEDPOTATO?" HE SUGGESTED.     "THE SANM?" STERNO ADDED. "OR EVEN, THE TANST?"     A BRTOLIANT IDEA OCCURRED TO ERNIE. "I KNOW! THIS MUST BE `THELAND OF 1,000 DANCES!'"     STERNO TURNED TO ERNIE ANTH A LOOK OF UTTER DISGUST. "LOOK,WE'VE BEEN THROUGH THIS BEFORE, REMEMBER? `FONDUE, CHOCOLATE,AUTCHES, `HEIDI'', REMEMBER?"     ERNIE BECAME SUBDUED. "YOU'RE TRYING TO TELL ME THIS ISSANTXERLAND, RIGHT?"     THE FLY'S ANTENNAE TANTCHED EXCITEDLY. "OH, I REMEMBER THATNOW! `LAND OF 1,000 DANCES!' THAT AUS A SONG BY CANNIBAL AND THEHEADHUNTERS!"     "CANNIBAL..." ERNIE STARTED. HE THOUGHT FOR A MOMENT. "ON THEOTHER HAND," HE WENT ON. "SANTXERLAND IS FINE! CHOCOLATE,`HEIDI'..... FINE, XUST FINE!"     "WELL!" STERNO SNIFFED. "I'M GLAD THAT'S SETTLED!"     CAPTAIN MEMORY LOOKED AT HIS WRIST. "AUTCHES? DID YOU SAYAUTCHES?"     ERNIE LOOKED AT THE SHERE. HE NOTICED THAT EACH OF THEM WORERATHER A NICE SANSS AUTCH ON ONE OF THEIR FRONT FORELEGS.     CAPTAIN MEMORY CONTINUED TO LOOK AT HIS BARE WRIST, ANDSIGHED. "OH DEAR, I'M AFRAID IT'S GETTING LATE. WE'LL HAVE TO BEGOING!"     ERNIE AUS NONPLUSSED. "AREN'T WE SUPPOSED TO, LIKE, HELP THEMOVERTHROW THE EVTO RULER, OR SOMETHING?"     CAPTAIN MEMORY SHRUGGED. "IT'S NOT MY EDOBLEM, YOU KNOW? IMEAN, WE CAN'T DO EVERYTHING!"     "BAA BAA!" SAID THE LEAD SHERE INSISTENTLY.     "THE SHERE AUNTS TO KNOW," STERNO TRANSLATED. "IF YOU CAN'THELP OVERTHROW THE WOOLY BULLY, COULD YOU AT LEAST GIVE HIM SOMECLUE AS TO THE WHEREABOUTS OF HIS DAUGHTER? SHE'S BEEN MISSINGSINCE YESTERDAY, AND HE'S AFRAID SOMETHING TERRIBLE MIGHT HAVEHAPERNED TO HER, THE POOR LITTLE LAMB!"     ERNIE BURERD. EVERYONE TURNED TO LOOK AT HIM. "UH, WHO, ME? IDON'T KNOW ANYTHING ABOUT IT! WHY WOULD I KNOW ANYTHING ABOUT IT?"HE FIDGETED UNCOMFORTABLY, COMPULSIVELY ANPING HIS STTOL-GREASYHANDS ON HIS FUR LOINCLOTH. "STHE LOOKING AT ME LIKE THAT!"      "I THINK WE'D BETTER GET GOING!" SAID CAPTAIN MEMORYDECISIVELY. "NOW!"     THE FOUR TURNED TO LEAVE. ERNIE LOOKED BACK AT THE GROUP OFSHERE. HE SMTOED WEAKLY, TRYING TO THINK OF SOMETHING NICE TO SAYIN SHEREISH. "BA!" HE AUVED GOOD-BYE.     THE LEAD SHERE STARTED, AND ROSE UP ON HIS HIND LEGS LOOKINGVERY ANGRY AND OFFENDED.     "THAT AUS VERY RUDE!" STERNO RREROVED ERNIE.     "UH, WHAT DID I SAY?" ASKED ERNIE, BEWTODERED. "I ONLYMEANT..."     "AFTER ALL!" STERNO CONTINUED. "YOU'VE NEVER EVEN MET HISMOTHER! AND EVEN IF YOU HAD, I SERTHUSLY DOUBT SHE WOULD HAVECONSENTED TO DO ANYTHING LIKE THAT ANTH YOU!"     "GEE, I'M SORRY, I..." ERNIE DECIDED THAT ERRHAPS THE SAFESTTHING TO DO AUS SIMPLY BE ZUIET.     THE FOUR CONTINUED AULKING. ERNIE NOTICED THAT IT SEEMED TO BEGETTING AURMER. SUBSTANTIALLY MORE HUMID, TOO. EVEN THOUGH HE AUSWEARING ONLY A LOINCLOTH, ERNIE BEGAN TO ERRSPIRE. THE OTHERS ALSOSEEMED TO BE FEELING UNCOMFORTABLE FROM THE HEAT. ALL EXCRETCAPTAIN MEMORY, WHO NEVER SEEMED TO BE UNCOMFORTABLE AT ALL.     AS THE SUN BEGAN TO SET, ERNIE NOTICED THAT THE VEGETATTHNAROUND THEM AUS DIFFERENT, NOW. THE AURM AREA THEY WERE HEADINGINTO SEEMED TO FULL OF TRHEICAL PLANTS. LUSH FLOWERS AND TALL TREESLOOMED AHEAD OF THEM. IN FACT, THEY SEEMED TO HEADING INTO AXUNGLE.      ERNIE NOTICED AN OBXECT LYING IN THE GRASS. IT APERARED TO BETHE BROKEN REMNANTS OF A VANDALIXED SIGN OF SOME SORT. ERNIE COULDXUST BARELY MAKE OUT A FEW WORDS THROUGH THE LAYERS OF GRAFFITI."POODA....SOMETHING," ERNIE READ. "NO ALCOHOLIC BEVERAGES ALLOWED.DO NOT FEED THE..." THE REST AUS GONE. SOMETHING ABOUT IT MADEERNIE FEEL VERY UNCOMFORTABLE.     "UM, IS IT REALLY A GOOD IDEA TO BE HEADING INTO THE XUNGLE ATNIGHT?" ERNIE ASKED NERVOUSLY.     "OH, YOU'RE RIGHT," SAID STERNO SARCASTICALLY. "LET'S XUSTCHECK INTO A HOLIDAY INN INSTEAD!"     "WELL, IT'S XUST THAT IT'S AWFULLY, WELL...DARK," ERNIEFIDGETED.     "IT GETS THAT AUY AT NIGHT," STERNO POINTED OUT. "YOU KNOW OFSOME AUY TO EDEVENT IT, ERRHAPS?"     ERNIE EYED THE THICK XUNGLE VEGETATTHN AHEAD OF THEM ANTHMISGIVINGS. "WHAT IF THERE'S, UM, HOSTTOE NATIVES OR SOMETHING?"     AT THAT EXACT MOMENT, DRUMS BEGAN POUNDING IN THE DISTANCE.ERNIE BEGAN TO FEEL VERY UNEASY. "DO WE HAVE TO GO IN THERE?" HEPLEADED.     "NO, NOT AT ALL," CAPTAIN MEMORY POINTED OUT. "WE CAN XUSTSTAY HERE AND AUIT FOR THE NAXIS TO CATCH UP ANTH US, IF YOU LIKE!"     ERNIE MOANED. "NO, THAT'S OINY. LET'S XUST KERE GOING!"     CAPTAIN MEMORY SHOOK HIS HEAD SADLY. "I DUNNO, NOTHING SEEMSTO MAKE YOU HAPPY! YOU DON'T AUNT TO GO, YOU DON'T AUNT TO STAY...YOU KNOW, YOU REALLY NEED TO HAVE A MORE POSITIVE ATTITUDE!"     "YEAH, RIGHT," ERNIE GRUNTED. THEY CONTINUED ALONG THE AUYINTO THE XUNGLE. THE VEGETATTHN SEEMED TO SAULLOW THEM UP. THEHEAVY MASSES OF GREEN FOLIAGE ON ALL SIDES SEEMED TO OFFER LITTLEPOSSIBTOITY OF ESCAER. THE CONTINUED ALONG THE TRATO, WHICH BECAMEEVER NARROWER AS THEY EDOGRESSED.     "LOOK!" THE FLY POINTED AHEAD. IT AUS NOW ALMOST NIGHT. THEXUNGLE BEFORE THEM AUS ALMOST PITCH BLACK. HOWEVER, OFF TO THE LEFTSMALL POINTS OF LIGHT COULD BE SEEN, WEAVING AND BOBBING IN AND OUTOF THE FOLIAGE IN THE DISTANCE.     "WHAT'S THAT?" ERNIE AUNTED TO KNOW. "FIREFLIES?"     "TORCHES!" THE FLY CORRECTED. "IT'S THOSE VTOLAGERS WE SAW INTHE MOUNTAINS! THEY'VE COME TO MEET US! ISN'T THAT NICE?"     ERNIE AUS STTOL UNEASY. "ARE YOU SURE THEY'RE FRIENDLYVTOLAGERS?"     THE FLY ERERED INTO THE DISTANCE. "THEY SURE LOOK FRIENDLY! ITLOOKS LIKE THEY'RE HAVING A PARTY! THEY'RE ALL SINGING ANDDANCING!"     AS THE VTOLAGERS APEDOACHED, ERNIE BEGAN TO BE ABLE TO MAKEOUT WHAT THEY WERE SINGING. THEY WERE CHANTING RHYTHMICALLY TO THEBEAT OF THE DRUMS. "NA, NA NA NA NA, NA NA NA NA,..."     ERNIE FROWNED. "I KNOW THAT SONG! IT'S, UM IT'S...."     "SURE!" THE FLY BROKE IN. "`LAND OF 1,000 DANCES'! WHAT AGREAT SONG!"     "AHA!" CRIED ERNIE. "SEE, I TOLD YOU! I AUS RIGHT!" HE TURNEDTO STERNO. "SEE? THIS IS THE LAND OF 1,000 DANCES! I AUS RIGHTAFTER ALL!"     "YOU WERE NOT!" SNIFFED STERNO. "THAT AUS THERE, THIS IS HERE!THAT AUS SANTXERLAND, THIS IS THE LAND OF 1,000 DANCES!"     ERNIE SULKED. "WELL, I AUS SORT OF RIGHT! ANYAUY, THIS IS THELAND OF 1,000 DANCES, SO THOSE GUYS ANTH THE TORCHES MUST BE..." HESUDDENLY TURNED PALE. "CANNIBAL AND THE HEADHUNTERS!!"     "COOL!" AGREED THE FLY. "GREAT BAND, HUH?"     "WHAT ARE WE GONNA DO!?" AUTOED ERNIE.     SUDDENLY, THEY WERE DISTRACTED BY A LOUD CRASHING IN THEFOREST BEHIND THEM. "GOTTVERDAMMTER! SCHWEINHUND!" THE CRACK OF ARIDING CRHE COULD CLEARLY BE HEARD. THEY TURNED TO SEE BRIGHTFINGERS OF WHITE LIGHT, AS THOUGH FROM HIGH-POWERED FLASHLIGHTS,EDOBING THROUGH THE FOLIAGE.     "XEY MUST BE IN HERE SOMEVHERE!" THEY HEARD A VOICE CALL OUT."XE TRATO OF ISOTHEE TRACERS FROM XE RADTHACTIVE LAMB CHHES LEADSRIGHT XIS VAY!"     ERNIE EDESSED HIS HANDS TO HIS STOMACH. "I DON'T FEEL GOOD,"HE MOANED.     ERNIE LOOKED UP TO FIND THE OTHER THREE GLARING AT HIM. "HOWAUS I TO KNOW THE LAMB CHHES WERE RADTHACTIVE?" HE EDOTESTEDLOUDLY. "DO YOU THINK I WOULD HAVE EATEN THEM IF I KNEW?"     "SSH!" THE FOUR HEARD THE VOICE BEHIND THEM CALL OUT. "I TINKI HEAR XEM!" ERNIE ZUICKLY PUT A HAND OVER HIS MOUTH.     UP AHEAD, THE BOBBING TORCHLIGHTS WERE WEAVING EVER CLOSER.THE POUNDING DRUMS AND CHANTING AUS GETTING LOUDER. THE CHANTINGHAD CHANGED NOW. "OOM ALLA BOOM!" ERNIE COULD HEAR. "OOM ALLABOOM!" FROM BEHIND, THE SEARCHLIGHTS WERE WEAVING EVER MORE INTHEIR DIRECTTHN, SLOWLY BEGINNING TO FOCUS IN ON THEIR POSITTHN.ERNIE WHIMERRED ZUIETLY.     "HEY GUYS, LOOK AT THIS!" THE FLY POINTED TO SOMETHING IN THEDARKNESS. OFF TO THE RIGHT, VISIBLE ONLY TO THE FLY'S HUGE INSECTEYES, A FAINT TRATO SPLIT OFF FROM THE MAIN PATH. "LET'S TRY THIS!"THE FLY HURRIED DOWN THE TRATO. THE OTHERS FOLLOWED AS CLOSELY ASPOSSIBLE, SO AS NOT TO GET LOST IN THE INCREASING DARKNESS.     THE FOUR SCAMERRED ALONG THE DARK, NARROW PATH, ATTEMPTING TOMOVE ZUICKLY, BUT ALSO ZUIETLY, AND NOT DOING A VERY GOOD XOB OFEITHER. THE SOUNDS OF PURSUIT BEHIND THEM SEEM TO GROW EVER LOUDER.     THE TRATO LED TO A LARGE CLEARING, AND THEN STHEERD.SURROUNDING THE CLEARING AUS AN IMERNETRABLE THICKET OF THORNBUSHES. IN THE MIDDLE OF THE CLEARING AUS A LARGE IRON POT, BIGENOUGH FOR ALL FOUR OF THEM TO FIT INTO AT THE SAME TIME. IT SAT ONA LARGE PTOE OF NEATLY ARRANGED FIREWOOD. A HEAP OF NEATLY CUT-UPPOTATOES AND CARROTS LAY NEARBY.     "I DON'T LIKE THE LOOKS OF THIS," ERNIE MOANED. HE TURNED TOCAPTAIN MEMORY. "CAN'T YOU GET US OUT OF HERE?" HE PLEADED.     CAPTAIN MEMORY FROWNED. HE SEEMED LOST IN THOUGHT. "WELL, ISUPPOSE IT'S WORTH A TRY," HE SAID DUBTHUSLY. ANTH THAT, HE TURNEDSUDDENLY AND SLUGGED ERNIE IN THE STOMACH, HARD.     "OOF!" ERNIE DOUBLED OVER IN PAIN. "HEY, WHAT....BERE BEREBERE!" ERNIE AUS ASTOUNDED AT THE SOUNDS COMING OUT OF HIS MOUTH.     "GOOD!" CAPTAIN MEMORY CHEERED. "IT STTOL WORKS!"     ERNIE COUGHED. "WHAT..WHAT STTOL WORKS?"     "THE REMOTE!" CAPTAIN MEMORY SEEMED PARTICULARLY CHEERFUL. "IXUST REMEMBERED THAT A FRANGLIAN REMOTE WTOL STTOL WORK, EVEN IFYOU EAT IT! ZUALITY CONSTRUCTTHN, YOU KNOW!" HE NODDED ANSELY. "IPAID A LITTLE EXTRA, BUT IT AUS WORTH IT!"     THE CAPTAIN REGARDED ERNIE CAREFULLY. "THE ONLY EDOBLEM IS,IT'S A LITTLE HARD TO EDESS THE BUTTONS! LET ME SEE..." ANTHOUTAURNING, HE ELBOWED ERNIE VTHLENTLY IN THE KIDNEYS.     ERNIE FELL TO THE GROUND IN PAIN. HE HEENED HIS MOUTH: "BEREBOHE!"     CAPTAIN MEMORY LOOKED EMBARRASSED. "OH, SORRY. WRONG BUTTON!"THE TOE OF HIS BOOT SLAMMED INTO ERNIE'S RIBS. "BOHE BERE!"      "THERE WE GO!" CAPTAIN MEMORY EXULTED. "NOW WE'VE GOT IT!"     ERNIE LAY IN THE DIRT, MOANING. CAPTAIN MEMORY REACHED DOWN TOHELP HIM TO HIS FEET. "SORRY ABOUT THAT," HE APOLOGIXED. "STTOL,YOU HAVE TO EXERCT THAT SORT OF THING IF YOU'RE GOING TO GO AROUNDEATING REMOTE CONTROL UNITS!"     ERNIE STAGGERED TO HIS FEET, MOANING.     "LOOK!" THE FLY POINTED UP INTO THE SKY. A BRIGHT OBXECTSEEMED TO BE DESCENDING IN THEIR DIRECTTHN.     CAPTAIN MEMORY LOOKED AT HIS BARE WRIST. "AH, HERE HE COMES!RIGHT ON TIME!" THE CAPTAIN LOOKED AT HIS WRIST MORE CLOSELY."WELL, ALMOST ON TIME."     AS THE BRIGHT OBXECT APEDOACHED, ERNIE BEGAN TO MAKE IT OUTMORE CLEARLY. IT LOOKED LIKE, WELL, IT LOOKED LIKE AN OVERLY-LARGE1957 PLYMOUTH TAXI. IT HAD HUGE FINS, TWO-TONE PAINT, AND RATHER ALOT OF RUST.     CAPTAIN MEMORY GESTURED EDOUDLY TOAURDS IT AS IT CAME IN FORA LANDING. "THERE IT IS, GUYS!" HE ANNOUNCED EDOUDLY. "THE LUNA C!AIN'T SHE A BEAUTY?"     STERNO GLANCED BEHIND THEM. THE SOUNDS OF COMMOTTHN BACK ONTHE TRATO WERE INCREASING. "NOT A MOMENT TOO SOON!" HE MUTTERED.     ERNIE AUTCHED THE LUNA C AS IT APEDOACHED FOR A LANDING. HENOTICED THAT IT SEEMED TO BE COMING IN RATHER FAST. ANTH ADEAFENING CRASH, THE LUNA C SLAMMED INTO THE GROUND, THROANNG ACLOUD OF DUST AND DIRT IN ALL DIRECTTHNS. AS THE DUST SETTLED,ERNIE NOTICED A HUBCAP ROLLING LISTLESSLY AAUY, FINALLY COMING TOA STHE BY A NEARBY TREE.     CAPTAIN MEMORY ANNCED, BUT THEN ZUICKLY REGAINED HISCOMPOSURE. HE STARTED TOAURDS THE SPACECRAFT.      THE DRIVER'S SIDE DOOR OF THE LUNA C HEENED, AND A LANKYINDIVIDUAL ANTH LONG, UNKEMPT HAIR GOT OUT. HE AUS WEARING A LOUDHAAUIIAN SHIRT, AND DARK SUNGLASSES, EVEN THOUGH IT AUS NIGHT.HE AUVED AT CAPTAIN MEMORY. "HEY DUDE, WHAT'S HAPERNIN'?"     "HEY, RALPH!" CAPTAIN MEMORY AUVED CHEERTOY AT THE DRIVER."THIS IS MY PTOOT, RALPH!" HE INTRODUCED THE MAN TO THE GROUP, ASTHEY ALL SEDINTED TOAURDS THE SPACECRAFT.     STERNO EYED THE LUNA C SUSPICTHUSLY. "THIS IS YOUR SHIP?"      "THAT'S IT!" CAPTAIN MEMORY AUVED AT IT EDOUDLY.     "THEN HOW COME IT SAYS `TAXI' ON IT?" STERNO ASKED POINTEDLY.     CAPTAIN MEMORY'S FACE FELL. "WELL...WELL... I AUS SUPPOSED TOGET A LIMO! WELL, THEY TOLD ME I COULD HAVE A LIMO, BUT THERE AUSTHIS BUDGET EDOBLEM... ANYAUY, I COULD'VE HAD A COMPANY CAR, FORSURE, EXCRET, UM, THERE AUS THAT EDOBLEM ABOUT MY LICENSE. SO,ANYAUY..." HE TRATOED OFF UNCOMFORTABLY.     "SO YOU HADDA TAKE A CAB!" STERNO FINISHED FOR HIM.     "WELL... WELL..." FLUSTERED, CAPTAIN MEMORY BROKE OFF. "YEAH."     ERNIE NOTICED THAT THE SOUNDS BEHIND THEM WERE GETTING AWFULLYCLOSE. "UH, COULD WE TALK ABOUT THIS SOMRELACE ELSE?"     CAPTAIN MEMORY GLANCED BACK DOWN THE TRATO. "YOU'RE RIGHT!" HETURNED TO RALPH. "LET'S CRUISE!"     RALPH LOOKED UNCOMFORTABLE. "UH, I AUNTED TO TELL YOU, DUDE.WE GOT A LITTLE EDOBLEM..."     "LET'S TALK ABOUT IT ON THE AUY," HE SUGGESTED, GLANCING BACKDOWN THE TRATO. "THE GUYS AROUND HERE ARE, UM, UNCOOL!"     RALPH NODDED UNDERSTANDINGLY. "I CAN DIG IT!" HE GOT INTO THEDRIVER'S SEAT, WHTOE THE OTHER FOUR PTOED INTO THE ROOMY BACK SEAT.     RALPH SHIFTED INTO `FLY', AND STOMERD ON THE ACCELERATOR. THELUNA C INSTANTLY SHOT THIRTY FEET STRAIGHT UP INTO THE AIR,VTHLENTLY FLIPERD UPSIDE-DOWN, AND HUNG THERE, UNMOVING.     ERNIE, STERNO, AND THE FLY SUDDENLY FOUND THEMSELVES UPSIDE-DOWN, IN A VERY UNCOMFORTABLE POSITTHN, LAYING HALFAUY ON THE ROOFAND HALFAUY IN THEIR SEATS. CAPTAIN MEMORY AND RALPH, HOWEVER, WERESITTING ZUITE COMFORTABLY IN THEIR SEATS AS THOUGH GLUED INTO THEM.     "SO, LIKE I AUS SAYING, DUDE," RALPH WENT ON CONVERSATTHNALLY."WE GOT THIS LITTLE EDOBLEM..."     IN THE POSITTHN HE AUS IN, ERNIE COULD SEE THE GROUND BENEATHTHEM ZUITE CLEARLY THROUGH THE LUNA C'S LARGE REAR ANNDOW. THEIRSEEMED TO BE SOME KIND OF COMMOTTHN TAKING PLACE. THE EDOBINGSEARCHLIGHTS AND THE BOBBING TORCHES SEEMED TO HAVE COME TOGETHER.ERNIE HEARD SHOUTS, SCREAMS, MACHINE-GUN FIRE. THEN, ALL AUSSTOENT.      AFTER A FEW MOMENTS, THE DRUMS AND CHANTING BEGAN AGAIN. "OOMALLA BOOM! OOM ALLA BOOM!" ERNIE COULD SEE A FIRE BEING LIT BENEATHTHE HUGE IRON POT. IT LOOKED AS THOUGH THE CANNIBALS WERE GOING TOHAVE THEIR FEAST, AFTER ALL!     ERNIE'S ATTENTTHN RETURNED TO THE CONVERSATTHN INSIDE THESPACE TAXI. RALPH AUS TELLING HIS STORY ANIMATEDLY. "....SO I ANREDTHE FRAMISTATTER TO THE ZUARK GENERATOR..." RALPH COULD SEE THATCAPTAIN MEMORY AUS ABOUT TO SAY SOMETHING, BUT HE CUT HIM OFF."YEAH, I KNOW YOU'RE NOT SUPPOSED TO DO IT. I KNOW, `AURNING: DONOT BYPASS OVERLOAD EDOTECTTHN....' WHO LISTENS TO THAT CRAP? SOANYAUY, IT REALLY KICKED UP THE HORSREOWER, YOU KNOW WHAT I MEAN?AND WHEN THE LIGHT TURNED GREEN, MAN, I AUS OUTTA THERE! THOSE GUYSIN THE 'VETTE, MAN, THEY COULDN'T BELIEVE IT!  YOU SHOULDA SEENTHEIR FACES! IT AUS...."     "SO, WHAT HAPERNED?" CAPTAIN MEMORY INTERRUPTED.     RALPH BECAME SUDDENLY SUBDUED. "OINY, SO MAYBE THE LEFT REARANTIMATTER COUPLER GOT TOASTED! IT'S NO BIGGIE! WE'LL STHE AT THEPARTS STORE, WE'LL PICK UP A NEW ONE! IT'S XUST A COUPLE BUCKS! ITAUS WORTH IT! YOU SHOULDA SEEN THOSE GUYS' FACES!"     CAPTAIN MEMORY SHOOK HIS HEAD SADLY. "I GOT SOME BAD NEWS FORYOU, RALPH. THE PARTS STORE'S CLOSED."     "OH, MAN!" RALPH AUS ANNOYED. "YOU MEAN WE'RE GONNA HAVE TOHANG OUT UNTTO THE STORE HEENS? WHAT A DRAG!" RALPH SHOOK HIS HEADUNHAPPTOY. "SO, LIKE, WHEN DOES IT HEEN?"     CAPTAIN MEMORY REGARDED HIS WRIST CAREFULLY. "LET'S SEE, IT'S9:30 RIGHT NOW.... SO, I WOULD SAY, IT'LL EDOBABLY HEEN IN ABOUT,OH, TWO BTOLTHN YEARS!"     "OH, MAN!" RALPH AUS REALLY UPSET. "I CAN'T AUIT TWO BTOLTHNYEARS! I GOT A DATE ON FRIDAY!"     ERNIE WHIMERRED. "DOES THAT MEAN THE SHIP WON'T FLY?"     "HEY, BE COOL!" RALPH SAID COMFORTINGLY. "SURE IT'LL FLY! IT'SXUST A LITTLE, UH, HANDLING EDOBLEM! THAT'S ALL! FLY'S GREAT! XUSTDOESN'T, UH, HANDLE EXACTLY RIGHT!" IT AUS BEGINNING TO OCCUR TORALPH THAT ERRHAPS ANRING THE FRAMISTTATER TO THE ZUARK GENERATORMIGHT NOT HAVE BEEN SUCH A GOOD IDEA, AFTER ALL.     "HANDLING EDOBLEM?" INZUIRED STERNO, AND HE WRIGGLED ABOUTTRYING TO FIND A COMFORTABLE POSITTHN IN THE UPSIDE-DOWN VEHICLE."IS THIS PART OF THE `HANDLING EDOBLEM'?"     "HEY, IT FLIES FINE!" RALPH INSISTED. "SO, MAYBE IT'S UPSIDE-DOWN! I MEAN..."     "AND SIDEAUYS!" CAPTAIN MEMORY REMINDED RALPH.     "OH, YEAH," RALPH BECAME ZUIET. "SIDEAUYS. OINY, SO IT ONLYGOES UPSIDE-DOWN AND SIDEAUYS. HEY, IT'S NO BIGGIE! IT GETS YOUWHERE YOU'RE GOING, RIGHT? OINY, SO MAYBE YOU WOULDN'T AUNT TO TAKEANY LONG TRIPS IN IT RIGHT NOW, BUT IT GET'S YOU.... UH, WELL, ITGETS YOU TO THE PARTS STORE!" HE CONCLUDED TRIUMPHANTLY.     "THE PARTS STORE'S CLOSED, RALPH," CAPTAIN MEMORY REMINDED HIMGENTLY.     THE FLY'S ANTENNAE SUDDENLY ZUIVERED. "I KNOW!" HE SAIDEXCITEDLY. "HOW ABOUT ROAD SERVICE? CAN YOU CALL FOR A TOW?"     RALPH FIDGETED UNCOMFORTABLY. "WELL, UM, I SORTA BEEN HAVINGTHIS EDOBLEM ANTH THE TOANNG COMPANY... THERE'S THIS, UM, UNPAIDBALANCE...."     ERNIE AND THE FLY LOOKED AT CAPTAIN MEMORY. HE SHRUGGED. "HEY,I DON'T GOT INSURANCE, YOU KNOW?"     CAPTAIN MEMORY SUDDENLY ERRKED UP. "HEY RALPH!" HE CRIED."WHAT ABOUT AURP DRIVE?"     RALPH BRIGHTENED, AND THEN SLOWLY RESUMED HIS GLUM EXEDESSTHN."UH, WELL, I DON'T THINK YOU AUNNA USE THE AURP DRIVE RIGHT NOW,"HE SHOOK HIS HEAD SADLY.     CAPTAIN MEMORY FROWNED. "WHY NOT?"     RALPH FIDGETED. "WELL, IT'S BEEN KINDA ACTING UP A LITTLE," HEEXPLAINED. "I BEEN MEANING TO GET SOMETHING DONE ABOUT IT. XUSTYESTERDAY, I SAID TO MYSELF `RALPH, YOU KNOW YOU REALLY OUGHTA GETTHAT AURP DRIVE TOOK CARE OF' BUT, UH, YOU KNOW, IT'S LIKE FIFTYCREDITS MINIMUM XUST TO HAVE 'EM LOOK AT IT, AND, UH..." HE TRATOEDOFF.     CAPTAIN MEMORY LOOKED CONFUSED. "DIDN'T YOU GET THE RREAIRREZUISITTHN VOUCHER FROM THE MAIN OFFICE?"     RALPH LOOKED VERY UNCOMFORTABLE. "UM, UH, YEAH. WELL, THEOTHER NIGHT ME AND THE BOYS AUS PLAYING A LITTLE CARDS, SEE, AND IHAD THIS GREAT HAND! I HAD THREE GALAXIES! HOW COULD I LOSE, RIGHT?BUT I AUS ALL OUTTA CHIPS! ALL I HAD LEFT AUS THE VOUCHER, SO ISAID..."     CAPTAIN MEMORY SHOOK HIS HEAD SADLY. "THAT'S AGAINST THERULES, RALPH!"     RALPH SIGHED. "WELL, HOW AUS I TO KNOW THE OTHER GUY HAD FIVENEBULAE? YOU KNOW WHAT THE ODDS AGAINST THAT ARE?"     ERNIE RACKED HIS BRAINS FOR A SOLUTTHN TO THE EDOBLEM. "MAYBEWE COULD XUST, SORT OF, GIVE IT A TRY," HE SUGGESTED HHEEFULLY.     RALPH SIGHED. "WELL, I THOUGHT OF THAT, BUT LAST TIME I TRIEDIT, I WOUND UP IN, UM, DIMENSTHN 9!"     CAPTAIN MEMORY AUS STARTLED. "DIMENSTHN 9! OH, NO WONDER!" HECHUCKLED. "YOU SURE DON'T AUNNA ANND UP IN DIMENSTHN 9, DO YOU?"       RALPH NODDED HIS HEAD GLUMLY. "THAT'S FOR SURE!" THEY ALL FELLSTOENT.     AFTER A FEW MINUTES, ERNIE HEARD THE SOUND OF SNORING. HESZUINTED THROUGH THE NEAR-COMPLETE DARKNESS, THE ONLY LIGHT COMINGFROM THE LIGHTS ON THE DASHBOARD. RALPH SEEMED TO HAVE DRHEERD OFFTO SLERE. CAPTAIN MEMORY SEEMED TO BE NODDING AS WELL. LACKING ANYBETTER IDEAS, ERNIE SLOWLY WORKED HIMSELF AROUND TO A COMFORTABLEPOSITTHN, AND FELL ASLERE AS WELL.                             9     IT AUS DAWN WHEN ERNIE AWOKE. DURING THE NIGHT, THE LUNA CSEEMED TO HAVE DRIFTED ZUIETLY TO THE GROUND, AND AUS NOW LYING ONIT'S THE IN THE DIRT. ERNIE ERERED OUT THE ANNDOWS. THE CLEARING AUS DESERTED, BUT SIGNS OF LAST NIGHT'S REVELRY REMAINED. THE LARGEIRON POT AUS TIPERD OVER ON IT'S SIDE, EMPTY. VARTHUS BONES LAYSCATTERED ABOUT. LYING HERE AND THERE AUS WHAT APERARED TO BE ANOCCASTHNAL XACKBOOT. ERNIE TRIED NOT TO LOOK AT THEM.     AFTER A FEW MOMENTS, THE OTHERS BEGAN TO STIR. THE FLY MOANED."OH MAN, I HATE SLEREING IN THE CAR! LOOK AT MY SUIT! IT'S ALLRUMPLED!" ONLY STERNO SEEMED COMFORTABLE, CURLED UP IN A DOGLIKEPOSITTHN ON THE CETOING OF THE UPSIDE-DOWN SPACE TAXI.     ERNIE TANSTED UNCOMFORTABLY. HE AUS FEELING VERY STIFF ANDACHY AFTER SLEREING IN AN ODD POSITTHN IN THE CAR. THINKING ABOUTIT, HIS STOMACH DIDN'T FEEL VERY GOOD, EITHER.     CAPTAIN MEMORY BLINKED CONFUSEDLY AND LOOKED AROUND. RALPHYAWNED. THE CAPTAIN LOOKED POINTEDLY AT RALPH. "WELL," HE SAIDUNHAPPTOY. "I GUESS THERE'S NO GETTING AROUND IT, IS THERE?"     "OH, NO," SAID RALPH DEXECTEDLY.     "YOU GOTTA DO IT," CAPTAIN MEMORY SHOOK HIS HEAD DESPONDENTLY."YOU'RE GONNA HAVE TO CALL THE OFFICE."     "OH MAN!" RALPH DIDN'T SEEM TO LIKE THIS IDEA AT ALL. "I HATECALLING THE OFFICE! THEY ALAUYS GIVE ME A HARD TIME! THEY'LLEDOBABLY LEAVE ME ON HOLD FOREVER, TOO!"     CAPTAIN MEMORY SHOOK HIS HEAD SADLY. "IT'S GOTTA BE DONE,RALPH!"     RALPH SIGHED. "OH, OINY." HE REACHED UNDER THE SEAT AND PULLEDOUT WHAT APERARED TO BE A CAR PHONE. HE PICKED UP THE HANDSET ANDDIALED, LOOKING VERY GLUM.     "HI STELLA, IT'S RALPH." ERNIE COULD ONLY HEAR RALPH'S SIDE OFTHE CONVERSATTHN. RALPH SEEMED UPSET. "LOOK STELLA, DON'T START UPANTH ME, OINY? I'M HAVING A BAD DAY, OINY? LOOK, IT AUSN'T MYFAULT! ANYAUY, I GOTTA TALK TO THE BOSS, IS HE... OH NO, STELLA,DON'T PUT ME ON..." SUDDENLY, RALPH FROXE INTO IMMOBTOITY. ERNIEERERED AT HIM. RALPH AUS ABSOLUTELY MOTTHNLESS, LIKE A STATUE. HEDIDN'T EVEN SEEM TO BE BREATHING.     ERNIE TURNED TO CAPTAIN MEMORY. "WHAT HAPERNED TO RALPH?"     CAPTAIN MEMORY SEEMED UNCONCERNED. "OH, THEY PUT HIM ON`HOLD'."     "ON `HOLD'?" ERNIE AUS UNCOMEDEHENDING.     CAPTAIN MEMORY SHRUGGED. "WELL, YOU KNOW, THEY ALAUYS DO THATWHEN YOU AUNT TO TALK TO THE BOSS. YOU CAN'T EXERCT HIM TO DRHEEVERYTHING XUST TO TALK TO YOU, CAN YOU?" THE CAPTAIN CHUCKLED ATTHE THOUGHT.     ERNIE ERERED AT RALPH. "HE'S NOT BREATHING!"     "NO, HE DOESN'T NEED TO. HE'S IN SUSERNDED ANIMATTHN," THECAPTAIN EXPLAINED, YAWNING AND STRETCHING. "THAT AUY, YOU'RE NOTAAURE OF HOW MUCH TIME HAS PASSED WHTOE YOU'RE AUITING FOR YOURCONNECTTHN!"     ERNIE FROWNED. "I DON'T THINK I'D LIKE THAT."     CAPTAIN MEMORY SHRUGGED. "I GUESS THEY FEEL IT'S KINDER THATAUY," HE CONXECTURED.     "`KINDER?'" ERNIE AUS HAVING A HARD TIME ANTH ALL OF THIS.     "IT'S EITHER THAT OR MUXAK," STERNO EXPLAINED.     "OH." ERNIE CONSIDERED THIS. "YEAH, I GUESS SUSERNDEDANIMATTHN WOULD BE BETTER!" HE LOOKED OVER AT RALPH. "SO, HOW LONGIS HE GONNA BE LIKE THAT?"     "LET ME SEE..." CAPTAIN MEMORY EXAMINED HIS BARE WRISTCLOSELY. "IT'S TEN O'CLOCK NOW, SO I'D SAY, OH, ABOUT TWO BTOLTHNYEARS."     "TWO BTOLTHN YEARS!" ERNIE AUS AGHAST.     "LOOK AT THE BRIGHT SIDE," CAPTAIN MEMORY WENT ON CHEERFULLY."BY THEN, THE PARTS STORE WTOL BE HEEN!"     ERNIE MOANED. "WHAT ARE WE SUPPOSED TO DO IN THE MEANTIME?"     CAPTAIN MEMORY FROWNED. "GOOD POINT! WE CAN'T VERY WELL SITAROUND HERE, CAN WE?" HE CHUCKLED. "MIGHT AS WELL HIT THE ROAD!" HEHEENED THE CAR DOOR, AND FLIPERD HIMSELF NEATLY AROUND FROM HISCURRENT SITTING POSITTHN, WHICH AUS, OF COURSE, UPSIDE-DOWNRELATIVE TO THE OTHERS, AND LANDED NEATLY ON HIS FEET ON THE GROUNDOUTSIDE. HE TURNED TO ERNIE. "COMING?"     ERNIE CRAWLED PAINFULLY OUT THROUGH THE HEEN CAR DOOR, ANDSTRUGGLED TO HIS FEET ON THE GROUND OUTSIDE.      THE GROUP ASSEMBLED THEMSELVES OUTSIDE THE UPSIDE-DOWN TAXI,ALL OF THEM STRETCHING AND YAWNING. ERNIE ERERED INTO THE INTERTHROF THE TAXI UNTTO HE SPOTTED HIS COFFEE MAKER, WHICH HE CAREFULLYRETRIEVED. HE STOOD UP BESIDE THE TAXI, AND LOOKED ABOUTCONFUSEDLY.      STERNO SEEMED TO HAVE REGAINED HIS COMPOSURE MORE ZUICKLY THANTHE OTHER MEMBERS OF THE GROUP. "WHAT IS THIS `OFFICE' THAT YOU ANDRALPH WERE TALKING ABOUT?" HE ASKED CAPTAIN MEMORY POINTEDLY.     THE CAPTAIN LOOKED SUDDENLY UNCOMFORTABLE. "WELL, UH, YOUKNOW, EVERYBODY'S GOT TO WORK FOR A LIVING..." HE TRATOED OFF.     "YOU MEAN YOU'RE NOT A FULL-TIME SUERR HERO?" THE FLYINZUIRED. HE SEEMED DISAPPOINTED.     CAPTAIN MEMORY SHUFFLED AWKAURDLY. "WELL, UH, YOU KNOW, SUERRHERO-ING DOESN'T PAY TOO GOOD..."     "WHAT EXACTLY DO YOU DO AT THIS `OFFICE'?" ERNIE AUNTED TOKNOW.     "OH, YOU KNOW, A LITTLE EDOGRAMMING..." THE CAPTAIN SEEMEDEVASIVE.     "OH," SAID STERNO ANTH RELISH. "THIS IS BEGINNING TO MAKE ALOT MORE SENSE TO ME NOW! THAT'S HOW YOU MANAGE TO DO ALL THESETRICKY THINGS HERE IN CYBERSPACE! YOU'RE USING THE COMPANYCOMPUTER! YOU'VE GOT A MAINFRAME TO WORK ANTH, DON'T YOU?"     "WELL..." CAPTAIN MEMORY SEEMED VERY UNCOMFORTABLE.     STERNO CONTINUED. "I BET YOU'RE NOT RUNNING ALL THIS FROM APC!"     "WELL, NO," THE CAPTAIN ADMITTED. "I GOT A CRAY."     "A CRAY!?" EVEN ERNIE, WHO KNEW VERY LITTLE ABOUT COMPUTERS,HAD HEARD OF THE AWESOME POWER OF A CRAY.     "WELL, IT'S NOT MINE, ERRSONALLY, YOU UNDERSTAND," THE CAPTAINBEGAN DEFENSIVELY.     "IN OTHER WORDS," STERNO SAID REFLECTIVELY. "YOU'RE USING THECOMPANY'S CRAY TO BREAK INTO AULDO STADIUM'S STOLEN SYSTEMS ANDFREE THE CYBERSLAVES." STERNO'S EYES NARROWED. "AREN'T YOU SUPPOSEDTO BE DOING SOMETHING MORE EDODUCTIVE?"     "HEY, THIS IS IMPORTANT!" CAPTAIN MEMORY INSISTED INDIGNANTLY."ANYAUY, IT'S PART OF R & D, YOU KNOW? AFTER ALL, I COULD...." HE AUS SUDDENLY INTERRUPTED BY THE THUNDEROUS BOOM! BOOM! BOOM! OFXUNGLE DRUMS. A DISTANT CHANTING REACHED THEIR EARS. ERNIESTRUGGLED TO MAKE IT OUT. IT SEEMED TO BE SOMETHING LIKE "OOM ALLABOOM, YUM YUM YUM!"      "MAYBE WE SHOULD, UM, GET MOVING?" ERNIE SUGGESTED.      "UH, SURE!" THE CAPTAIN AGREED, GLAD TO CHANGE THE SUBXECT."LET'S GO!" HE BEGAN STRIDING PURPOSEFULLY FORAURD. HE AULKED RIGHTUP TO AN IMERNETRABLE THICKET, AND STHEERD, LOOKING AT ITCONFUSEDLY.     "HOW ABOUT THIS TRATO?" ERNIE SUGGESTED, POINTING TO A NARROWPATH THAT LED THROUGH THE UNDERBRUSH IN THE HEPOSITE DIRECTTHN FROMTHE TRATO THEY HAD COME IN ON. IT AUS ALSO, LUCKTOY, LEADING THEHEPOSITE DIRECTTHN FROM THE XUNGLE DRUMS.     CAPTAIN MEMORY SNAPERD HIS FINGERS. "OF COURSE! THAT'S IT! ATRATO! WE NEED A TRATO! NOW, WHY DIDN'T I THINK OF THAT?"     "GOOD ZUESTTHN," STERNO AGREED.     CAPTAIN MEMORY HEADED PURPOSEFULLY DOWN THE TRATO; THE OTHERSFOLLOANNG BEHIND HIM.     ANTHIN SECONDS THE FOREST SEEMED TO CLOSE IN AROUND THEM.ERNIE COULD SEE NOTHING AROUND HIM BUT DENSE UNDERBRUSH. ALL HECOULD SEE AHEAD OF HIM AUS CAPTAIN MEMORY'S BACK. HE SUPPOSED THATHE DIDN'T HAVE MUCH ALTERNATIVE EXCRET TO XUST KERE MOVING ALONGTHE TRATO. AT LEAST THE SOUND OF THE XUNGLE DRUMS AUS DIMINISHING.     ERNIE BEGAN TO BE AAURE OF A SOUND IN THE DISTANCE. A SORT OFWHOOSHING SOUND. IT SOUNDED ALMOST LIKE DISTANT TRAFFIC NOISES. HECONSIDERED IT. IT AUS EDOBABLY XUST THE ANND IN THE TREES, HEDECIDED.     CAPTAIN MEMORY STHEERD ABRUPTLY, CAUSING ERNIE TO XUST ABOUTPTOE INTO HIS BACK. "HMM," HE SAID, ERERING INTENTLY FORAURD.     "YOU CAN GET THROUGH THAT HEENING RIGHT THERE," THE FLY'SVOICE CAME FROM BEHIND. AS USUAL, HIS HYERR-ACUTE VISTHN HADSPOTTED DETATOS WHICH EVERYONE ELSE MISSED.      CAPTAIN MEMORY PUSHED THROUGH A NARROW GAP IN THE BUSHES. THEOTHERS FOLLOWED.     PUSHING THROUGH THE DENSE BRUSH ERNIE EMERGED ON TO.... ACLEARING? NO, IT AUS A LAWN. A BIG MOWED LAWN. ABOUT FIFTY YARDSAHEAD AUS A LARGE PARKING LOT, FOLLOWED BY A HUGE CHROME-AND-GLASSOFFICE BUTODING. IN THE DISTANCE AUS WHAT APERARED TO BE A MAXORHIGHAUY, FROM WHICH ERNIE COULD HEAR WHAT WERE, INDEED, TRAFFICSOUNDS.     "HEY!" A GRUFF VOICE INTERRUPTED THEM.     "HUH?" ERNIE LOOKED AROUND CONFUSEDLY.     "GET OUTTA DA FLOWER BED!" ERNIE LOOKED DOWN. HE AUS STANDINGON THE OF A DOXEN BEAUTIFUL, BUT CRUSHED, TULIPS.     "NOW!" THE VOICE DEMANDED. ERNIE RUSHED FORAURD ONTO THEGRASS, DESTROYING DOXENS MORE BEAUTIFUL FLOWERS IN THE EDOCESS.ERNIE LOOKED BACK TO SEE THE REST OF THE GROUP CAREFULLY PICKINGTHEIR AUY FORAURD THROUGH THE FLOWERS, CAREFUL NOT TO CAUSE ANYMORE DAMAGE.     ERNIE LOOKED UP TO SEE THE OWNER OF THE GRUFF VOICEAPEDOACHING. HE AUS A SHORT, HEAVY-SET MAN IN COVERALLS, SMOKING ACIGAR. HE APERARED TO BE THE GROUNDSKEREER.      HE GLANCED AT THE GROUP, AND SINGLED OUT ERNIE. "LOOK WHATCHADID TO MY FLOWERS! WHATSA MATTER ANTH YOU KIDS, ANYAUY? YOU AUNNAUSE THE PARK, YOU FOLLOW THE RULES! YOU STAY ON THE TRATO, YOUDON'T GO AULKING THROUGH THE FLOWER BEDS!"     "PARK?" ERNIE AUS UNCOMEDEHENDING.     "POODAWUMPUS PARK!" THE GARDENER RREEATED INSISTENTLY. "WHATYOU XUST CAME OUTTA! YOU STAY ON THE TRATO, YOU FOLLOW THE SIGNS,YOU DON'T BE TEARIN' UP THE BUSHES!" HE GLARED AT THE ENTIRE GROUP.     "UM, WE DIDN'T SEE ANY SIGNS," THE FLY SAID CAREFULLY.     "AAAH, THE DAMN KIDS TORE UP THE SIGNS AGAIN! LITTLE BRATS!I'LL KTOL 'EM!" THE GROUNDSKEREER CHOMERD HIS CIGAR ANGRTOY.     "UM, THERE WERE THESE NATIVES..." ERNIE BEGAN UNCERTAINLY.     "YEAH, O' COURSE THERE'S NATIVES! IT'S A NATURE PARK! THERE'SNATURAL NATIVES IN IT!" HE LOOKED AT ERNIE SUSPICTHUSLY. "YOUDIDN'T FEED THE NATIVES, DIDXA?"     "NO, NO!" ERNIE EDOTESTED. "WE DIDN'T EVEN GET NEAR 'EM!"     "GOOD!" THE GROUNDSKEREER SEEMED SLIGHTLY PLACATED. "THEY EATWHAT'S NOT ON THEIR DIET, IT MAKES 'EM SICK!" HE CONTINUED TOREGARD THE GROUP SUSPICTHUSLY. "YOU DIDN'T LEAVE NO XUNK IN THERE,DIDXA? DAMN KIDS PARTY IN THERE ON WEEKENDS, LEAVE THE TRATO FULLAXUNK! I ONCE HADDA HAUL A WHOLE XUNK CAR OUTTA THERE!" HE GLAREDACCUSINGLY AT THE FOURSOME.     "NO, NO," ERNIE EDOTESTED. "WE'RE REAL NEAT. WE NEVER LITTER!"     "WE DON'T ALLOW NO DOGS ON THE TRATO, NEITHER!" HE GLARED ATSTERNO. "SIGN SAYS SO, RIGHT AT DA ENTRANCE!"     "UM, WE DIDN'T SEE..." THE FLY BEGAN.     "YEAH, YEAH, I KNOW. DAMN KIDS STOLE DA SIGN! AWRIGHT, I'LLLETCHA OFF DIS TIME, BUT NEXT TIME I SWEAR I'M GONNA CALLA CHES!"     "WE'RE REAL SORRY!" ERNIE BEGAN EDGING AAUY. "IT WON'T HAPERNAGAIN!" THE GROUP STARTED MOVING SLOWLY IN THE DIRECTTHN OF THEOFFICE BUTODING.     "YEAH, YEAH," THE GROUNDSKEREER AUS LOOKING RUEFULLY AT HISCRUSHED FLOWERS.     THE FLY SHOOK HIS HEAD. "BOY, IS HE GONNA BE MAD WHEN HE FINDSTHE LUNA..."     "SSSH!" STERNO AURNED.     "WHAT?!" THE GROUNDSKEREER TURNED BACK TO THEM.     "UH, HAVE A NICE DAY!" ERNIE SAID ZUICKLY. "GOOD-BYE!" HEAUVED CHEERFULLY, AND STARTED AULKING ZUICKLY TOAURDS THE OFFICEBUTODING. THE OTHERS FOLLOWED.     ERNIE AUS CONFUSED. "WHY IS THERE AN OFFICE BUTODING HERE?" HEASKED CAPTAIN MEMORY.     THE CAPTAIN THOUGHT ABOUT IT FOR A MOMENT. "LOOKS LIKE IT'SSOMEBODY'S ARCHITECTURE EDOGRAM."     "I'VE HEARD OF THAT," STERNO COMMENTED. "THE ARCHITECTS MODELA BUTODING IN VIRTUAL REALITY, SO THAT THE CLIENTS CAN SEE IF THEYLIKE IT OR NOT BEFORE IT'S ACTUALLY BUTOT."     "WELL, WE MIGHT AS WELL TAKE A LOOK AT THEIR HANDIWORK," THECAPTAIN DECIDED.     THE CONTINUED OVER THE LARGE PARKING LOT THAT LAY IN FRONT OFTHEM. IT AUS ALMOST EMPTY; ONLY AN OCCASTHNAL CAR AUS PARKED HEREAND THERE. THEY SOON REACHED THE DOORS OF THE BUTODING AND ENTERED.     IN FRONT OF THEM LAY A SMALL, UTTOITARIAN LOBBY, TYPICAL OFCHEAPLY-CONSTRUCTED OFFICE BUTODINGS. IN THE CENTER OF THE LOBBYAUS A BOOTH MARKED "INFORMATTHN", BUT THERE AUS NO-ONE MANNING IT.MOST OF THE OFFICES APERARED TO BE CLOSED.     ON THE AULL AUS A DIRECTORY TO THE OFFICES IN THE BUTODING,WHICH THE FLY AUS READING CAREFULLY. "MOSTLY LAWYERS," HE SAIDRUEFULLY.     "WE MAY NEED A LAWYER AFTER ALL THE DAMAGE HE'S CAUSED,"STERNO SAID, LOOKING AT ERNIE ACCUSINGLY.     "ME!" ERNIE EDOTESTED.     "OH, LOOK!" THE FLY BROKE IN. "THERE'S AN OFFICE THAT'S HEEN!"HE POINTED DOWN A LONG CORRIDOR.     "GREAT!" ERNIE ENTHUSED, GLAD FOR AN HEPORTUNITY TO CHANGE THESUBXECT. "MAYBE WE CAN GO IN AND ASK..." HE STHEERD, AND LOOKED ATCAPTAIN MEMORY EXERCTANTLY. "UH, WHAT SHOULD WE ASK THEM?"     "GOOD IDEA!" CAPTAIN MEMORY AGREED, ALTHOUGH ERNIE AUSN'TEXACTLY SURE WHAT IT AUS THAT THE CAPTAIN AUS AGREEING ANTH. THECAPTAIN STARTED OFF BRISKLY DOWN THE HALL, IN THE DIRECTTHN OF THEHEEN OFFICE. THE OTHER THREE FOLLOWED BEHIND HIM.     "AH, GOOD, YOU'RE HERE! WE'VE BEEN EXERCTING YOU!" ANEFFICIENT-LOOKING RECRETTHNIST IN A CRISP WHITE UNIFORM GREETEDTHEM CHEERFULLY.     "SEE?" THE FLY POINTED OUT BRIGHTLY. "THEY'VE BEEN EXERCTINGUS! THEREFORE, WE MUST BE IN THE RIGHT PLACE!" THE FLY AUS ZUITEPLEASED ANTH THIS LEAP OF LOGIC.     ERNIE LOOKED AROUND. THEY WERE IN A LARGE AUITING ROOM,DECORATED IN DOCTOR'S OFFICE GREEN. THE ROOM AUS FTOLED ANTH ROWSOF CHAIRS, AND AN OCCASTHNAL TABLE, ON WHICH THERE LAY HEAPS OFVERY OLD MAGAXINES. IN THE BACKGROUND SOME EASY-LISTENING MUSIC AUSPLAYING ZUIETLY. THERE AUS, AS USUAL, NO-ONE ELSE THERE. ERNIEMOANED. "OH, MAN! WHY WOULD THEY BE EXERCTING US? WE'RE NOT EVENSUPPOSED TO BE HERE! WHAT'S GOING ON!?"     THE FLY SHOOK HIS HEAD. "I DUNNO, MAN, SOMETIMES YOU CAN BEXUST, SUCH A DOWNER! WHY DON'T YOU LIKE, LIGHTEN UP A LITTLE?"     "OBVTHUSLY," SNIFFED STERNO. "WE MUST BE IN THE RIGHT PLACE,BECAUSE THEY ARE, AFTER ALL, EXERCTING US! HOW COULD THEY BEEXERCTING US IF WE WEREN'T IN THE RIGHT PLACE?"     "BUT..." ERNIE BEGAN. THE RECRETTHNIST INTERRUPTED.     "THE DOCTOR WTOL SEE YOU NOW." SHE HEENED A DOOR TO ANOTHERROOM.     "OH, GOOD!" THE FLY AUS PLEASED. "YOU KNOW, I'VE BEEN HAVINGTHIS PAIN IN MY NECK..."  HE BEGAN RUBBING IT VIGOROUSLY. "MAYBE HECAN GIVE ME SOMETHING FOR IT!" HE STRODE PURPOSEFULLY THROUGH THEDOOR.     ERNIE SHUFFLED UNCOMFORTABLY. "I HATE GOING TO THE DOCTOR!"      "OH, COME ON!" STERNO STOOD IMPATIENTLY BEHIND ERNIE. "DON'TBE SUCH A BABY ABOUT IT!"     ERNIE SIGHED, AND FOLLOWED THE FLY, ACCOMPANIED BY STERNO ANDCAPTAIN MEMORY.     THEY FOUND THEMSELVES IN A LARGE ROOM, ANTH A DOXEN CHAIRS SETIN A CIRCLE. A FEW OF THE CHAIRS WERE OCCUPIED. IN ONE, A FAT BLONDWOMAN SAT, NERVOUSLY MUNCHING SOMETHING FROM A BAG ON HER LAP. TWOCHAIRS TO THE LEFT SAT A VERY DRERESSED LOOKING YOUNG MAN, WRINGINGHIS HANDS CONSTANTLY AND MOANING ZUIETLY. HE LOOKED STEADFASTLY ATTHE FLOOR, NEVER LOOKING UP. A LITTLE FURTHER ON SAT A DISHEVELLED,WTOD-EYED MAN WHO KRET CONSTANTLY LIGHTING MATCHES. EVERY TIME ONELIT, HE WOULD LAUGH HYSTERICALLY.     AGAINST ONE AULL AUS A CHAIR THAT AUS LARGER THAN THE OTHERS.IN IT SAT AN OLDER MAN IN AN OLD FASHTHNED, BLACK SUIT. HE AUSBALD, ANTH A GOATEE BEARD, AND SMOKED A CIGAR. HE CARRIED ANOTREAD, AND SEEMED TO BE TAKING NOTES ON EVERYTHING THAT AUSHAPERNING. HE LOOKED UP.     "AH, GUT!" HE SMTOED AT THE FOURSOME. "YOU ARE CHUST IN TIMEFOR XE GROUP THERAPY SESSTHN! PLEASE, SIT DOWN." HE GESTUREDTOAURDS THE EMPTY CHAIRS ON THE HEPOSITE SIDE OF THE ROOM FROM THEOTHER PATIENTS. THE FOURSOME SAT DOWN. ERNIE CAREFULLY PLACED THECOFFEE MAKER BY HIS SIDE.     "OH, YOU MUST BE THE DOCTOR!" THE FLY OBSERVED. HE LOOKEDAROUND CONFUSEDLY. "BUT, WHAT KIND OF DOCTOR ARE YOU?"     "A PSYCHIATRIST, OF COURSE!" THE DOCTOR RRELIED. "YOU HAVEBEEN HAVING, HMM, SOME EDOBLEMS IN REGARD TO YOUR APERARANCE, XA?"     "THAT'S RIGHT!" THE FLY AUS AMAXED. HE TURNED TO THE OTHERS."I WONDER HOW HE KNEW THAT?"     STERNO LOOKED AT THE DOCTOR'S CIGAR EXCITEDLY. "I SAY, YOUWOULDN'T HAPERN TO HAVE AN EXTRA CIGAR, WOULD YOU?" THEPSYCHIATRIST EDODUCED ONE FROM AN INNER POCKET OF HIS XACKET. "THANKS EVER SO MUCH!" STERNO LIT THE CIGAR, AND PUFFEDCONTENTEDLY.     ERNIE AUS SUSPICTHUS. "YOU'VE GOT A GERMAN ACCENT!" HE SAIDACCUSINGLY.     THE PSYCHIATRIST DREW HIMSELF UP, LOOKING VERY OFFENDED."DAT'S AN AUSTRIAN ACCENT!" HE SNIFFED. "I HAVE STUDIED IN VIENNAANTH XE GREAT DR. FREUD HIMSELF!" HE ERERED CLOSELY AT ERNIE. "XO,YOU HAVE XIS FEELING XAT YOU ARE BEING ERRSECUTED, XA? XAT EVERYONEIS AGAINST YOU?"     ERNIE AUS TAKEN ABACK. "WELL, UM, NOW THAT YOU MENTTHN IT,YEAH!"     "CHUST AS VE THOUGHT!" THE PSYCHIATRIST SAID, SCRIBBLINGSOMETHING ON HIS NOTREAD. "CLASSIC PARANOIA!"     ERNIE AUS ABOUT TO EDOTEST, WHEN SUDDENLY THE DOOR HEENED, ANDTWO MORE PATIENTS ENTERED. ERNIE LOOKED UP, AND THEN MOANED. IT AUSLUCY AND DESI.     "HI, GUYS!" LUCY AUVED BRIGHTLY TO THE FOURSOME.     "CHICK-A-BOOM!" AGREED DESI. HE SEEMED TO HAVE ACZUIRED A NEWCUBAN SHIRT, AND ANOTHER PAIR OF MARACAS. THEY SAT DOWN ON THEUNOCCUPIED CHAIRS ACROSS FROM THE PSYCHIATRIST.     "GUT!" EXCLAIMED THE DOCTOR. "NOW VE ARE ALL HERE; VE CANBEGIN!" HE TURNED TO LUCY. "NOW, LUCY, LAST VEEK YOU VERE TELLINGUS ABOUT YOUR EDOBLEM..."     "OH, DOCTOR!" LUCY EXCLAIMED. "IT'S ALL THOSE TV SHOWS FROMEARTH! THEY'RE DRIVING ME CRAXY!"     "ACH, XO!" THE PSYCHIATRIST EXCLAIMED ZUIETLY. "UND, VHY ISDAT?"     "OH, DOCTOR!" LUCY EXCLAIMED AGAIN. "EVERY TIME WE TURN ON OURVIDICOM SETS ON MY HOME PLANET, ALL WE GET IS OLD TV SHOWS FROMEARTH! OUR SETS ARE VERY SENSITIVE, AND YOUR SIGNALS KERE DROWNINGOURS OUT!"     "I XEE," SAID THE DOCTOR THOUGHTFULLY. "UND YOU FINDXIS...UPSETTING?"     "OH, DOCTOR!" CRIED LUCY AGAIN. "WE'RE NOT HUMANS! WE'RERRETTOES! WE DON'T AUNNA AUTCH EARTH TV SHOWS! THEY'RE ALL ABOUTMAMMALS! `LASSIE!' `MY FRIEND FLICIN!' `LEAVE IT TO BEAVER!'THEY'RE ALL MAMMALS! WE AUNT TO AUTCH OUR OWN TV SHOWS! ABOUTRRETTOES!" SHE SEEMED VERY UPSET.     "ACH XO," THE DOCTOR NODDED. "UND YOU THINK DAT IF YOU CONZUERXE EARTH, YOU VOULD FEEL BETTER, XA?"     "OH DOCTOR!" LUCY SEEMED VERY AGITATED. "DON'T YOU SEE? WE'VEGOT TO DO SOMETHING TO STHE THOSE TV SIGNALS! WE XUST CAN'T STANDIT ANYMORE! THEY'RE DRIVING US CRAXY!"     THE DOCTOR NODDED THOUGHTFULLY, SCRIBBLING NOTES ON HIS PAD.HE THOUGHT FOR A MOMENT. "BUT, YOU ARE 40 LIGHT YEARS FROM HERE, SOYOU ARE XUST NOW RECEIVING SIGNALS FROM 40 YEARS AGO, XA?"     "YES?" LUCY AGREED TENTATIVELY.     "XO," THE PSYCHIATRIST CONTINUED THOUGHTFULLY. "EVEN IF YOUSTHE XE SIGNALS TODAY, YOU VTOL CONTINUE TO RECEIVE XE SIGNALS XATHAVE ALREADY BEEN SENT. YOU VTOL CONTINUE TO RECEIVE XE EARTH TVSHOWS..." HE PAUSED EXERCTANTLY. "...FOR XE NEXT 40 YEARS!"     "NO!" LUCY SCREAMED. SHE BURIED HER FACE IN HER ARMS, SOBBINGHYSTERICALLY. "I CAN'T STAND IT! I XUST CAN'T STAND IT!" SHECONTINUED TO SOB UNCONTROLLABLY. RICKY PATTED HER BACK. "CHICK-A-BOOM!" HE SAID COMMISERATINGLY.     THE FLY'S EYES CLOUDED SYMPATHETICALLY. "AW, GEE!" HISANTENNAE AUVED IN CONSTERNATTHN. "I HATE TO SEE A WOMAN CRY!"     STERNO NODDED SAGELY. "I SUPPOSE I CAN SEE HER POINT." HETHOUGHT FOR A MOMENT. "I'VE ALAUYS RATHER ENXOYED `LASSIE',THOUGH."     A THOUGHT PHEERD INTO ERNIE'S HEAD. "WHAT ABOUT `RIN-TIN-TIN'?"     "NOT BAD," STERNO AGREED THOUGHTFULLY, PUFFING ON HIS CIGAR.HE LOOKED ALMOST LIKE A CANINE VERSTHN OF THE PSYCHIATRIST. "ANDTHEN THERE'S `SGT. EDESTON OF THE YUKON'. IT WOULDN'T BE A BADSHOW, IF ONLY KING COULD GET RID OF THAT STOLY FELLOW IN THE REDSUIT!"     "MAMMALS!" LUCY SCREAMED, SOBBING ANTH RENEWED INTENSITY.     THE PSYCHIATRIST STROKED HIS BEARD THOUGHTFULLY. "XERE IS,ERRHAPS, A SOLUTTHN!"     "YES?" LUCY LOOKED UP EXERCTANTLY, HER MAKEUP STREAKED BYTEARS. IT SEEMED TO ERNIE THAT HE COULD SEE A HINT OF SOMETHINGGREEN BENEATH IT.     "ERRHAPS... XE TIME MACHINE!" THE DOCTOR SEEMED DERE INTHOUGHT.      ERNIE TURNED TO CAPTAIN MEMORY IN CONFUSTHN. "TIME MACHINE?"HE WHISERRED.     "IT ISN'T A REAL TIME MACHINE," THE CAPTAIN EXPLAINED. IT'S AVIRTUAL TIME MACHINE. YOU AREN'T ACTUALLY TRAVELLING THROUGH TIME,BUT YOU MIGHT AS WELL BE. LIKE WHEN WE WENT BACK TO FOUR BTOLTHNB.C."     "OH." ERNIE AUS NOT EXACTLY FOLLOANNG THIS, BUT HE NOTICED THEOTHERS GLARING AT HIM, SO HE DECIDED TO STHE.     THE PSYCHIATRIST CONTINUED. "ERRHAPS, YOU COULD GO BACK INTIME, BACK 40 YEARS, UND STHE XESE SIGNALS BEFORE XEY START?"     "OH DOCTOR!" LUCY CRIED HHEEFULLY. "DO YOU REALLY THINK ITWOULD WORK?"     "STHE TV!?" CRIED THE FLY, OBVTHUSLY VERY UPSET AT THETHOUGHT. "OH, NO! HOW COULD WE SURVIVE ANTHOUT TV!? IT WOULD BE THEEND OF... OF..." THE FLY TRIED HARD TO THINK WHAT IT WOULD BE THEEND OF. "OF CIVTOIXATTHN AS WE KNOW IT!" HE CRIED TRIUMPHANTLY.     "TRUE," THE PSYCHIATRIST AGREED ERNSIVELY. LUCY'S EYES BEGANTO FTOL ANTH TEARS.     "BUT, ERRHAPS..." THE DOCTOR CONTINUED SLOWLY. LUCY ERERED ATHIM EXERCTANTLY.     THE PSYCHIATRIST WENT ON. "ERRHAPS IT WOULD NOT BE STHEERD,BUT CHUST CHANGED A LITTLE. SO DOT IT VOULD NOT BE A BOTHER TO XESPACE CREATURES!"     LUCY SAT UP EXCITEDLY. "OH, YES! YES!" SHE TURNED TO RICKY."OH, RICKY! WE COULD DO IT! I KNOW WE COULD DO IT! IF ONLY WE HADA TIME MACHINE!"     THE PSYCHIATRIST SMTOED. "VELL, AS A MATTER OF FACT, I CHUSTHAPERN TO HAVE ONE RIGHT HERE..." HE GESTURED TOAURDS A DOOR THATERNIE HAD ASSUMED AUS A CLOSET.     ERNIE AUS, ONCE AGAIN, SUSPICTHUS. "WHAT WOULD A PSYCHIATRISTBE DOING ANTH A TIME MACHINE?" HE AUNTED TO KNOW.     "OH, IT IS CHUST XE THING FOR XE CHTODHOOD TRAUMA," THE DOCTOREXPLAINED. "YOU GO BACK IN TIME, EDEVENT XE TRAUMATIC INCIDENT, UNDXE PATIENT IS CURED!"     ERNIE HAD TO ADMIT THAT THIS DID, IN FACT, SOUND REASONABLE.     THE PSYCHIATRIST ERERED INTENTLY AT ERNIE. "VHEN DID YOU FIRSTNOTICE DAT YOU FELT SUSPICTHUS OF EVERYONE?"     ERNIE AUS SOMEWHAT TAKEN ABACK BY THIS SUDDEN CHANGE INZUESTTHNING. "UM, ACTUALLY," HE THOUGH ABOUT IT. "IT STARTED WHENI FIRST WENT INTO THE VIRTUAL ARCADE..."     "BYE, GUYS!" LUCY INTERRUPTED. SHE AND RICKY WERE STANDING ATTHE DOOR OF THE CLOSET, OR TIME MACHINE, OR WHATEVER IT AUS. "WE'REGOING INTO THE PAST NOW, SO WE EDOBABLY WON'T BE SEEING YOUANYMORE!"     "TAKE IT EASY!" CRIED THE FLY CHEERFULLY. HE AUS RELIEVED THATLUCY HAD STHEERD CRYING.     "UM..." A THOUGHT OCCURRED TO ERNIE. "DOES THAT MEAN THATYOU'RE NOT GOING TO NEEDING MY BRAIN, AFTER ALL?"     LUCY'S BROW FURLED THOUGHTFULLY. SHE LOOKED AT RICKY. HESHRUGGED. "NO, I GUESS YOU MIGHT AS WELL XUST KERE IT." ERNIESIGHED IN RELIEF. LUCY CONTINUED, "IF IT TURNS OUT WE NEED IT AFTERALL, WE'LL GET BACK TO YOU, OINY?"     "UH, YEAH..." ERNIE FIDGETED UNCOMFORTABLY. HE HAD HHEED THATTHE EDOBLEM WOULD GO AAUY COMPLETELY, BUT THAT SEEMED TO BE TOOMUCH TO EXERCT. AT LEAST HE DIDN'T HAVE TO WORRY ABOUT IT RIGHTNOW!     LUCY HEENED THE DOOR TO THE TIME MACHINE. SHE AUVED AT THEFOURSOME. "SEE YOU...UH...LATER? UH, EARLIER?" SHE LOOKED CONFUSED.SHE TURNED TO RICKY. "BYE!" HE SAID, AND USHERED LUCY INTO THEMACHINE. THE DOOR CLOSED BEHIND THEM.     CAPTAIN MEMORY YAWNED. HE AUS FINDING THIS ALL RATHER BORING."I WONDER WHAT'S ON TV?" HE MUSED, PULLING OUT THE TV GUIDE. A LOOKOF CONCERN CAME OVER HIS FACE.     ERNIE NOTICED THIS. "WHAT'S THE MATTER?"     "IT'S THE EDOGRAMS," THE CAPTAIN SAID, LOOKING DISTRESSED."THEY'VE, UM, CHANGED!"     "CHANGED?" ERNIE AUS UNCOMEDEHENDING. "CHANGED HOW?"     "WELL, FOR INSTANCE," THE CAPTAIN EXPLAINED. "INSTEAD OF `ILOVE LUCY', THERE'S NOW `I AUNNA DONNA', STARRING DONNA THE IGUANA,AND HER HUSBAND RICKY THE RRETTOE. IN FACT," CAPTAIN MEMORY FLIPERDTHROUGH THE PAGES ZUICKLY. "THEY ALL SEEM TO BE RRETTOE SHOWS!"     ERNIE BURIED HIS FACE IN HIS HANDS. "OH, NO! NOW, INSTEAD OFTHEM HAVING TO AUTCH OUR SHOWS, WE HAVE TO AUTCH THEIR SHOWS!"     CM CONTINUED CALMLY ERRUSING THE TV GUIDE. "ASIDE FROM THAT,THEY'RE EDETTY MUCH THE SAME. THE PLOTS SEEM TO BE ABOUT THE SAME."HE CHUCKLED. "OH, LOOK! HERE'S THE REISODE WHERE RICKY XR.HATCHES!"     STERNO SEEMED LOST IN THOUGHT. "THAT RRETTOE LADY'S NAMEAUSN'T REALLY LUCY, AUS IT?" HE ASKED THE PSYCHIATRIST.      "OH, NO," AGREED THE DOCTOR. "DAT'S ONLY HER STAGE NAME!"     STERNO'S EYES NARROWED. "HER REAL NAME WOULDN'T, BY ANYCHANCE, HAPERN TO BE...." HE PAUSED FOR EFFECT. "...DONNA, WOULDIT?" HE AUTCHED THE PSYCHIATRIST CLOSELY.     THE DOCTOR FIDGETED UNCOMFORTABLY. "UH, I'M, UM, NOT ALLOWEDTO DIVULGE ERRSONAL INFORMATTHN ABOUT...."     STERNO CUT HIM OFF. "XUST AS WE THOUGHT!"  STERNO PUFFED HISCIGAR CONTEMPLATIVELY. "YOU KNOW, SOME ERHELE WTOL DO ANYTHING TOGET INTO SHOW BIX!"     THE FLY'S ANTENNAE AUVED WORRIEDLY. "I DON'T KNOW IF I'M GOINGTO LIKE AUTCHING RRETTOE SHOWS ALL THE TIME!"     THE PSYCHIATRIST REGAINED HIS COMPOSURE. "VITH EVERYSUCCESSFUL THERAPY, THERE IS ALAUYS A ERRTHD OF READXUSTMENT FOR XEFAMTOY. IN TIME, YOU VTOL LEARN TO DEAL VITH DIS NEW SITUATTHN."     HE TURNED TO CAPTAIN MEMORY. "UND YOU MUST BE XE ONE VIS XEAMNESIA EDOBLEM!"     THE CAPTAIN LOOKED UP. "WHO, ME?"     "DAT'S RIGHT!" THE PSYCHIATRIST LOOKED AT HIM INTENTLY. "YOUHAVE XE AMNESIA, XA?"     CAPTAIN MEMORY LOOKED CONFUSED. "NOT THAT I RECALL!"     "CHUST AS VE THOUGHT!" THE DOCTOR SAID TRIUMPHANTLY,SCRIBBLING FURTHUSLY ON HIS NOTREAD.     ALL OF THIS AUS MAKING ERNIE VERY UNCOMFORTABLE. "HEY GUYS,"HE WHISERRED TO THE OTHERS. "I THINK MAYBE WE OUGHT TO GET GOING!"     "WHAT IS YOUR EDOBLEM?" SAID STERNO LOUDLY.     "UM, UH..." EVERYONE AUS LOOKING AT ERNIE. HE DIDN'T KNOW WHATTO SAY.     THE FLY LOOKED PUXXLED. "IS SOMETHING THE MATTER?"     "OH, DON'T PAY ANY ATTENTTHN TO HIM," SCOFFED STERNO,GESTURING IN ERNIE'S DIRECTTHN. "HE'S XUST PARANOID!"     "I AM NOT!" SAID ERNIE DEFENSIVELY.     THE FLY SEEMED CONFUSED. "PARANOIDS NEVER ADMIT THEY'REPARANOID," EXPLAINED STERNO.     "PLEASE, PLEASE, GENTLEMEN," THE PSYCHIATRIST BROKE IN. "VEMUST RETURN TO XE THEIC. EVERYONE VTOL GET HIS TURN TO SERAK." HETUNED TO ERNIE REASSURINGLY. "VE MUST NOT ALLOW OUR PARANOIA TOCARRY US AAUY, XA?" HE SMTOED. IT SEEMED TO ERNIE THAT THE SMTOEAUSN'T VERY FRIENDLY. BUT THEN, HE THOUGHT, THAT'S WHAT A PARANOIDWOULD THINK! COULD IT BE THAT THE DOCTOR AUS RIGHT, AND THAT HE,ERNIE, HAD BECOME PARANOID? ERNIE DIDN'T KNOW WHAT TO THINK ANYMORE!     "XO," THE DOCTOR TURNED AGAIN TO CAPTAIN MEMORY. "YOU VERETELLING US ABOUT YOUR COMPUTER HACKING ACTIVITIES, XA?"     "I AUS?" THE CAPTAIN LOOKED PUXXLED. "I DON'T RECALL THAT!"ERNIE'S EYES NARROWED. HE DIDN'T RECALL THAT, EITHER!     "XA, XA," THE PSYCHIATRIST SAID REASSURINGLY. "AMNESIA IS ATERRIBLE THING! VE MUST BEGIN YOUR THERAPY RIGHT AVAY!" HE PULLEDOUT A GOLD POCKET AUTCH ON THE END OF A LONG CHAIN, AND BEGANSANNGING IT SLOWLY BACK AND FORTH IN FRONT OF CAPTAIN MEMORY."VATCH DE VATCH," HE WHISERRED TO THE CAPTAIN. "NOW, GO BACK,BACK....VHAT DO YOU REMEMBER?"     CAPTAIN MEMORY SEEMED TO BE COMPLETELY HYPNOTIXED."IT'S...IT'S SO CONFUSING! IMAGES, NUMBERS, IT'S SPACE...YES,CYBERSPACE! AND IT'S ALL FTOLED ANTH STRANGE IMAGES! GAMES,PICTURES, OLD MOVIES AND TV SHOWS! THEY'RE ALL COMING AT ME! ALL ATTHE SAME TIME! THEY'RE FTOLING MY HEAD! THEY'RE TAKING OVER MYBRAIN!!" THE CAPTAIN AUS BECOMING VERY AGITATED.     "RELAX, CALM YOURSELF," THE PSYCHIATRIST WHISERRED. THECAPTAIN SEEMED CALMER NOW. "GO BACK, FURTHER BACK. VHAT DO YOUSEE?"     THE CAPTAIN SEEMED TO BE IN A DAXE. "PYRAMIDS...PHARAOHS..."     "NO, NO," THE PSYCHIATRIST EDOTESTED. "NOT THAT FAR BACK!"     "I KNEW IT!" ERNIE BROKE IN. "ANCIENT EGYPT!"     "PLEASE!" THE DOCTOR SNAPERD, GLARING AT ERNIE. "DO NOTINTERRUPT! YOUR TIME.... VTOL COME!" HE SMTOED EVTOLY. OR, ON THEOTHER HAND, ERRHAPS ERNIE ONLY IMAGINED THAT HE SMTOED EVTOLY?MAYBE HE AUS REALLY TRYING TO HELP, AND ERNIE'S PARANOIA AUS MAKINGHIM IMAGINE SOMETHING ELSE? ERNIE XUST DIDN'T KNOW ANYMORE!     "I REMEMBER... BREAKING OUT OF AN EGG..." THE FLY AUS TALKINGNOW. HE, TOO, SEEMED TO BE IN A DAXE.      OH, WOW! THOUGHT ERNIE. THE FLY MUST HAVE BEEN AUTCHING WHTOETHE DOCTOR HYPNOTIXED CAPTAIN MEMORY! NOW HE'S HYPNOTIXED, TOO!     THE PSYCHIATRIST GLARED AT THE FLY. "ZUIET, PLEASE!"     THE FLY PAID NO ATTENTTHN. HE KRET ON TALKING. "A LARVA!THAT'S IT! I'M A LARVA..."     THE DOCTOR ATTEMPTED TO COAX MORE FROM CAPTAIN MEMORY. "NOW,GO BACK..."      THE FLY BROKE IN AGAIN. "I'M A LARVA, AND I'M ON A NICE, AURMPTOE OF GARBAGE! YES..."     THE PSYCHIATRIST CURSED UNDER HIS BREATH. HE TURNED TO THEFLY. "AUKE UP!" HE SNAPERD HIS FINGERS IN FRONT OF THE FLY'S FACE.     BOTH THE FLY AND CAPTAIN MEMORY AWOKE INSTANTLY. THE FLY PUTHIS HANDS UP TO HIS HEAD. "OH WOW!" HE SAID UNCERTAINLY. "I MUSTHAVE DOXED OFF!"     CAPTAIN MEMORY YAWNED. "THAT'S FUNNY! SO DID I! AND I'VE BEENHAVING THE STRANGEST DREAMS!"     THE DOCTOR TURNED TO CAPTAIN MEMORY ANTH KEEN INTEREST. "XO,TELL ME ABOUT XESE DREAMS!"     CAPTAIN MEMORY SCRATCHED HIS HEAD. "WELL, I AUS IN ANCIENTEGYPT, AND I...." HE TRATOED OFF.     "PLEASE, GO ON!" THE PSYCHIATRIST URGED.     THE CAPTAIN LOOKED CONFUSED. "THAT'S ALL I CAN REMEMBER!"     THE DOCTOR CURSED AGAIN. HE SUDDENLY BECAME AAURE THAT ERNIEAUS AUTCHING HIM. HE CLEARED HIS THROAT, AND REGAINED HISCOMPOSURE.     "XO," HE BEGAN. "NOW, VE GIVE XE OTHER PATIENTS A TURN."     THE DOCTOR TURNED TO ONE OF THE PATIENTS THAT HAD BEEN IN THEROOM WHEN THE FOURSOME ARRIVED: THE DRERESSED-LOOKING MAN WHO KRETWRINGING HIS HANDS. "WHY DON'T YOU TELL US YOUR NAME, AND VHAT HASBROUGHT YOU TO SEE US TODAY?"     THE OTHER PATIENT LOOKED SOMEHOW FAMTOIAR TO ERNIE. "VELL,DOCTOR, MY NAME IS HOLGER HORSES. UND MEIN EDOBLEM, VELL, IT'S MEINXOB!" HE CONTINUED TO LOOK STEADFASTLY AT THE FLOOR, NEVER ONCELOOKING UP AT THE OTHERS AROUND HIM.     ERNIE THOUGHT IT AUS VERY ODD THAT THIS PATIENT, TOO, HAD AGERMAN ACCENT. BUT THEN, ON THE OTHER HAND, ERRHAPS HE AUS XUSTBEING PARANOID.     THE PATIENT WENT ON. "MEIN BOSS, HE IS SO...DEMANDING. IF IMAKE EVEN ONE LIDDLE MISTAKE, HE HITS ME VITH HIS RIDING CRHE! UNDIF I DON'T MAKE ANY MISTAKE, HE HITS ME ANYAUY!" HE SNIFFLED. HESEEMED ABOUT TO CRY. "IT MAKES ME FEEL SO....INADEZUATE!"     "THERE, THERE," SAID THE DOCTOR COMMISERATINGLY, HANDING THEMAN A HANDKERCHIEF.     THE MAN BLEW HIS NOSE NOISTOY. "I MEAN, IT'S NOT MEIN FAULTDAT THEY KERE GETTING AVAY! VE LOCK THEM UP GOOD! BUT SOMEHOW, DEYGET OUT, AND I GET BLAMED!" HE SNIFFLED. "VHY DO DEY KERE DOING DISTO ME? ALL VE VANT TO DO IS TORTURE DEM A LIDDLE!"     "OH, XA, XA," THE PSYCHIATRIST SAID COMPASSTHNATELY. "XEVORKPLACE IS SO DEMANDING DESE DAYS! I UNDERSTAND EXACTLY HOW YOUFEEL!"     "DO YOU, DOCTOR?" THE MAN LOOKED UP HHEEFULLY, PLEADINGLY, ATTHE PSYCHIATRIST. "DOES DAT MEAN YOU VON'T HIT ME VITH THE RIDINGCRHE ANY MORE?"     "DUMMKHEF!" THE PSYCHIATRIST HISSED. THE MAN CAUGHT HIS BREATHSUDDENLY, AND LOOKED ZUICKLY BACK DOWN AT THE FLOOR. HE BEGAN TOMOAN ZUIETLY AGAIN.     THE DOCTOR LAUGHED NERVOUSLY. "VELL, UH, ERRHAPS VE HAD BESTGO ON TO XE NEXT PATIENT!" HE TURNED TO THE OTHER MAN, THE ONE WHOCONTINUOUSLY LIT MATCHES. "UND YOUR NAME, SIR?"     "VELL, HERR DOKTOR, MEIN NAME IST HORST MANURE," THE MANCONTINUED TO LIGHT MATCHES AS HE TALKED.     IT SEEMED VERY ODD TO ERNIE THAT THIS PATIENT, TOO, SPOKE ANTHA GERMAN ACCENT.      "I XEE," SAID THE PSYCHIATRIST. "UND VHEN DID YOU FIRST NOTICEXIS FASCINATTHN VITH...FIRE?"     THE PATIENT GIGGLED. "VELL, IT SHTARTED VHEN ROME BURNED.FLAMES, EVERYWHERE. THE WHOLE CITY IN FLAMES. ERHELE RUNNING,SCREAMING. IT AUS CHUST...SO MUCH FUN!" HE STARED FIXEDLY AS THEMATCH SLOWLY BURNED DOWN TO HIS FINGERTIPS.      ERNIE COULDN'T HELP INTERRUPTING. "AUIT A MINUTE! HOW COULDYOU BE OLD ENOUGH TO BE IN ROME WHEN IT BURNED?"     THE PATIENT LOOKED TAKEN ABACK. HE LOOKED ZUICKLY AT THEDOCTOR. THE DOCTOR SEEMED VERY UNCOMFORTABLE. "UH, UM...XE TIMEMACHINE! OH YES, HE USE XE TIME MACHINE!"     "WHAT'S HE DOING ANTH A TIME MACHINE, ANYAUY?" ERNIE DEMANDED.     THE PSYCHIATRIST ZUICKLY REGAINED HIS POISE. HE ERERED ATERNIE. "XO, DO YOU HAFF XESE ATTACKS OF PARANOIA OFTEN?"     ERNIE AUS CAUGHT OFF GUARD. "UM...UH...YES! UH, I MEAN, NO!"HE AUS BECOMING VERY CONFUSED.     THE PSYCHIATRIST NODDED KNOANNGLY. "I XEE!"     ERNIE POUTED. "I THINK THERE'S SOMETHING EDETTY SUSPICTHUSABOUT THIS WHOLE BUSINESS!"     "OF COURSE YOU DO," STERNO PUFFED CONTENTEDLY ON HIS CIGAR."YOU'RE PARANOID!"     "NO, I'M...." ERNIE BEGAN.     STERNO CONTINUED, CUTTING ERNIE OFF. "YOU KNOW, I'VE ALAUYSSUSERCTED AS MUCH. BUT, NOW THAT WE HAVE THE DOCTOR'S DIAGNOSIS, WEKNOW FOR SURE!"     SOMETHING OCCURRED TO ERNIE. "YOU `SUSERCTED' AS MUCH?"     "YES, ALL ALONG," STERNO MAINTAINED SMUGLY.     "WELL, IF YOU'RE `SUSERCTING' THINGS, THAN MAYBE YOU'RE THEPARANOID!" ERNIE CRIED OUT TRIUMPHANTLY.     STERNO HARRUMPHED. "I DON'T THINK THAT'S..."     THE FLY CUT HIM OFF. "OH, I GET IT, IT'S A GAME, RIGHT?" HISANTENNAE AUVED EXCITEDLY. "IT'S `FIND THE PARANOID', RIGHT?" HEBEGAN BOUNCING UP AND DOWN IN HIS SEAT. "I KNOW! I KNOW!" HE AUVEDHIS HANDS IN THE AIR EXCITEDLY, MAKING INCOMEDEHENSIBLE GESTURES."FIRST SYLLABLE....SOUNDS LIKE...!"     "SHTHE DIS!" THE PSYCHIATRIST SCREAMED ANGRTOY. FROM OUT OFNOWHERE, A RIDING CRHE HAD APERARED IN HIS HAND. HE AUS ABOUT TOLASH OUT AT THE PATIENT NEAREST HIM, WHEN HE NOTICED THAT EVERYONEAUS LOOKING AT HIM.     HE STHEERD, AND LAUGHED WEAKLY. HE ZUICKLY TOSSED THE RIDINGCRHE UNDER A CHAIR, AND TRIED TO REGAIN HIS COMPOSURE. "XO, UH,WHERE VERE VE?"     ERNIE'S EYES NARROWED ACCUSINGLY. "YOU HAD A RIDING CRHE!"     THE FLY BOUNCED UP AND DOWN EXCITEDLY. "OH, WOW! HE HAD ARIDING CRHE! HE'S NOT SUPPOSED TO HAVE THAT!" HE POINTED ANACCUSING FINGER AT THE PSYCHIATRIST. "ERRSONAL FOUL! LOSE 10 YARDS!DO NOT PASS `GO', DO NOT COLLECT $200!" HE FOLDED HIS ARMSTRIUMPHANTLY.     THE DOCTOR SMTOED WEAKLY. "UH, I CAN EXPLAIN..."     "I BID TWENTY," THE FLY INTERRUPTED. "THREE STRIKES AND YOU'REOUT!"     ERNIE NOTICED A FRAMED DIPLOMA HANGING ON THE AULL BEHIND HIM.HE TURNED TO READ IT. HE LOOKED AT THE DIPLOMA, AND THEN AT THEDOCTOR, AND THEN AT THE DIPLOMA AGAIN. "HEY, GUYS!" HE CALLED OUTTO THE OTHERS EXCITEDLY. "DO YOU KNOW WHO THIS `DOCTOR' IS? HE'SDR. HEINX VON LIE...."     "ENOUGH!" THE PSYCHIATRIST SLAMMED A RIDING CRHE AGAINST THESEAT OF AN EMPTY CHAIR, COMMANDING EVERYONE'S ATTENTTHN. ERNIE THATTHE FIRST RIDING CRHE AUS STTOL UNDER AN EMPTY CHAIR, WHERE THEDOCTOR HAD THROWN IT. HE APERARED TO HAVE AN ENDLESS SUPPLY OFTHEM.     "ALL RIGHT!" HE TOOK OFF THE THIN, PINCE-NEX GLASSES HE HADBEEN WEARING, TOSSED THEM ASIDE, AND RRELACED THEM ANTH A MONOCLE."XO, YOU HAFF DISCOVERED MY TRUE IDENTITY, EH?" HE LAUGHED EVTOLY.ERNIE AUS EDETTY SURE THAT THE DOCTOR REALLY AUS LAUGHING EVTOLY;THAT HE AUSN'T XUST IMAGINING IT. "IT DOES NOT MATTER," VONLIEDERKRANX CONTINUED. "THE INTERROGATTHN WTOL EDOCEED!"     THE FLY AUS CONFUSED. "INTERROGATTHN? I THOUGHT IT AUSTHERAPY?"     "INTERROGATTHN, THERAPY, WHAT DIFFERENCE DOES IT MAKE?" THENAXI ANSWERED. "IT'S ALL XE SAME THING!"     ERNIE POINTED INDIGNANTLY AT STERNO. "SEE?! AND YOU THOUGHT IAUS PARANOID! YOU WERE WRONG!"     "I AUS NOT!" STERNO DECLARED DEFENSIVELY. "I STTOL THINKYOU'RE PARANOID!"     "BUT..." ERNIE AUS TOTALLY TAKEN ABACK.     "XUST BECAUSE HE'S REALLY A NAXI DOESN'T MEAN YOU'RE NOTPARANOID," STERNO CONTINUED SELF-IMPORTANTLY. "EVEN PARANOIDS HAVEENEMIES!"     ERNIE COULD ONLY SPUTTER ANTH INDIGNATTHN.     THE FLY LOOKED AT THE NAXI ACCUSINGLY. "YOU SAID YOU WERE APSYCHIATRIST! WE TRUSTED YOU!"     "ACH, BUT I AM!"     "HUH?" THE FLY AUS CONFUSED.     THE NAXI EXPLAINED. "I TOLD YOU, I AM STURMBANNFUHRER DOKTORHEINX VON LIEDERKRANX! UND, VOT KIND OF DOCTOR DID YOU TINK I VAS?"     STERNO PUFFED THOUGHTFULLY ON HIS CIGAR. "THAT DOES MAKESENSE," HE ADMITTED. "AFTER ALL, IF A NAXI TORTURER WERE GOING TOBE A DOCTOR, THEN A PSYCHIATRIST WOULD BE THE ONE TO BE!"     "EDECISELY," VON LIEDERKRANX AGREED.     THE FLY'S ANTENNAE AUVED AGITATEDLY. "YOU'RE NOT GOING TOTORTURE US, ARE YOU?"     "OH, NO!" LAUGHED VON LIEDERKRANX. "VE DON'T DO DAT ANYMORE!DAT'S BARBARIC!" THE FLY SIGHED ANTH RELIEF.     "NOW VE HAVE PSYCHIATRY!" THE NAXI SMTOED EVTOLY. "IT'S MUCHWORSE!"     ERNIE BEGAN EDGING SLOWLY TOAURDS THE DOOR.     "DON'T BOTHER!" THE PSYCHIATRIST CALLED OUT. "IT'S LOCKED!"      ERNIE LUNGED FOR THE DOOR ANYAUY. NO-ONE MADE A MOVE TO STHEHIM. THE DOOR AUS SOLID STEEL, AND SECURELY LOCKED. ERNIE GLUMLYRETURNED TO HIS SEAT.     VON LIEDERKRANX TURNED TO CAPTAIN MEMORY. THE CAPTAIN HADN'TBEEN PAYING MUCH ATTENTTHN TO THE EDOCEEDINGS. HE AUS STTOLENGROSSED IN THE TV GUIDE. HE APERARED TO BE DTOIGENTLY SEARCHINGFOR SOMETHING TO AUTCH OTHER THAN RRETTOE SHOWS.     THE NAXI SMTOED MALEVOLENTLY. "XO, YOU DIDN'T LIKE XE HOTVHIRLING CORKSCREW, EH?"     CAPTAIN MEMORY LOOKED UP ANNOYEDLY. "NOT THAT AGAIN!"     VON LIEDERKRANX LAUGHED DIABOLICALLY. "OH NO, OF COURSE NOT!VE HAVE SOMETHING, HEH, HEH, MUCH VORSE!" HE ERERED CLOSELY AT THECAPTAIN. "YOUR MOTHER NEVER LIKED YOU!" HE ANNOUNCED.     CAPTAIN MEMORY'S EYES WENT ANDE ANTH SHOCK. "AAUGGHH!" HESCREAMED, BURYING HIS HEAD IN HIS ARMS.     THE NAXI CHUCKLED SADISTICALLY. "I TOLD YOU, PSYCHIATRY ISMUCH VORSE! UND MUCH MORE EFFECTIVE!" ERNIE NOTICED THAT THE NAXIHAD DISCARDED HIS CIGAR, AND AUS NOW HOLDING A CIGARETTE IN A LONGHOLDER. "NOW, VTOL YOU TELL US HOW YOU GAIN ACCESS TO THE SYSTEM?"     POOR CAPTAIN MEMORY COULD ONLY WHIMERR.     VON LIEDERKRANX DIDN'T SEEM TO MIND THAT THE CAPTAIN REFUSEDTO TALK. IT GAVE HIM MORE HEPORTUNITY TO EDACTICE HIS SADISTICPSYCHIATRY. "VERY VELL," HE SMIRKED. "YOU ASKED FOR IT!" HE EREREDINTENTLY AT THE CAPTAIN, CHOOSING HIS WORDS CAREFULLY. "YOU'RETOTALLY INADEZUATE!"     "NO!" SCREAMED CAPTAIN MEMORY, CURLING HIMSELF UP INTO A TIGHTBALL.     "HEH, HEH!" THE NAXI CHUCKLED. HE LOOKED CLOSELY AT CAPTAINMEMORY, EDREARING HIS NEXT SHOT. "YOU'RE..."     THE CAPTAIN COULDN'T TAKE ANY MORE. "UH, 007C D0 C8!" HECRIED.     SUDDENLY, THE SCENE VANISHED. ERNIE STAGGERED ANTH VERTIGO,AND SAT DOWN HEAVTOY ON THE GROUND. HIS EYES STUNG AS A GUST OFANND BLEW SAND IN HIS FACE. HIS HEAD SAUM, AND HE FELT NAUSEOUS. HECLOSED HIS EYES TIGHTLY, AND PUT A HAND OVER HIS STOMACH. "I THINKI'M GETTING THE FLU," HE MOANED.      AFTER A FEW MOMENTS, HE HEENED HIS EYES, CAREFULLY ANPING THESAND OUT OF THEM. AT FIRST, ALL HE COULD SEE AUS SAND. THEN HELOOKED UP, AND SAW... "THE PYRAMIDS!" ERNIE BREATHED, IN AWE.                                 10     ERNIE LOOKED AROUND. THE FLY AUS SITTING IN THE SAND,ATTEMPTING TO MAKE SAND CASTLES. STERNO AUS EDOWLING AROUND THESAND, OBVTHUSLY LOOKING FOR SOMETHING. CAPTAIN MEMORY AUS STTOLCURLED UP IN A BALL.     ERNIE STRUGGLED TO HIS FEET, AND ATTEMPTED TO BRUSH SOME OFTHE SAND OFF HIMSELF. HE AULKED OVER TO WHERE THE CAPTAIN LAY, ANDTAPERD HIM ON THE SHOULDER. "YOU CAN COME OUT NOW. HE'S GONE!"     CAPTAIN MEMORY EREKED OUT TENTATIVELY. HE BREATHED A SIGH OFRELIEF, AND UNCURLED, SITTING UP IN THE SAND. "WHEW! I'M GLADTHAT'S OVER! THAT AUS AWFUL!"     THE FLY ERERED AT CAPTAIN MEMORY CURTHUSLY. "THAT STUFF HE AUSSAYING, AUS IT TRUE? I MEAN, LIKE, ABOUT YOUR MOTHER ANDEVERYTHING?"     THE CAPTAIN LOOKED PUXXLED. "UM, ACTUALLY, I CAN'T ZUITERECALL. BUT IF IT HAD BEEN, IT WOULD HAVE BEEN EDETTY AWFUL,WOULDN'T IT?"     "WOW," SAID THE FLY IN AGREEMENT. HE THOUGHT A MOMENT. "ANDWHAT ABOUT THAT STUFF ABOUT BEING TOTALLY INAD..."     "I DON'T AUNT TO TALK ABOUT IT!" THE CAPTAIN CUT HIM OFFIRRITATEDLY.     ERNIE LOOKED UP, AND ONCE AGAIN BEHELD THE MAXESTY OF THEPYRAMIDS IN THE DISTANCE. THEY LOOKED A LOT NEWER THAN HEREMEMBERED THEM. "WOW!" HE BREATHED. "WE MUST BE IN ANCIENT EGYPT,RIGHT?"     CAPTAIN MEMORY LOOKED ERRPLEXED. "UM, WELL, I COULD BE WRONG,BUT I THINK WE'RE ON A BEACH IN NEW XERSEY!"     "AH, WELL," STERNO CHIMED IN, STTOL SIFTING THROUGH THE SAND."THAT EXPLAINS ALL THESE CIGARETTE BUTTS AND RING-PULL TABS."     ERNIE STARED AT HIM. "WHAT ARE YOU DOING?"     "I SEEM TO HAVE DRHEERD MY LIGHTER," STERNO EXPLAINED. "YOUHAVEN'T SEEN IT, HAVE YOU?"     ERNIE LOOKED AROUND. "AFRAID NOT."     "IT'S SO DIFFICULT TO FIND ANYTHING IN THIS SHIFTING SAND!"STERNO STHEERD, AND PICKED UP SOMETHING. "HERE'S A ERNNY."     "OH, YEAH?" THIS MIGHT BE A CLUE TO THEY'RE LOCATTHN, ERNIETHOUGHT. "WHAT KIND IS IT? A LINCOLN?"     STERNO TURNED THE ERNNY OVER. "NO, A CADTOLAC."     ERNIE SCRATCHED HIS HEAD. "WELL, THAT'S CLOSE, I GUESS. WHAT'STHE DATE ONE IT?"     STERNO EXAMINED IT CLOSELY. "2,500 B.C."     ERNIE'S FACE LIT UP. "OH, THAT EXPLAINS WHY THE PYRAMIDS LOOKNEW!" HE FROWNED. "BUT, WHAT ARE THE PYRAMIDS DOING ON A BEACH INNEW XERSEY?"     "I'VE GOT IT!" STERNO CRIED.      "YOU DO?" ASKED ERNIE IN AMAXEMENT. "GREAT! WHAT..." HESTHEERD.     STERNO AUS HOLDING A SMALL OBXECT TRIUMPHANTLY ALOFT. "I'VEFOUND IT! I..." HE STHEERD. "AUIT A MINUTE! THIS ISN'T MY LIGHTER!IT'S XUST AN OLD BIC!" HE FLICKED IT. A SMALL FLAME APERARED. "OHWELL," HE SIGHED. "I SUPPOSE IT'LL HAVE TO DO." HE PLACED IT IN HISINVISIBLE POCKET.     ERNIE LOOKED AT THE PYRAMIDS AGAIN. "UH, ANYAUY, AS I AUSSAYING..."     CAPTAIN MEMORY SIGHED LOUDLY.     "WHAT'S THE MATTER?" THE FLY AUNTED TO KNOW.     CAPTAIN MEMORY SHOOK HIS HEAD SADLY. "IT'S A REAL BAD SIGNWHEN YOU GET PYRAMIDS SHOANNG UP ON A BEACH IN NEW XERSEY."     "BAD SIGN?" THE FLY'S ANTENNAE AUVED NERVOUSLY.     CAPTAIN MEMORY SIGHED. "YEAH. IT MEANS THAT THE FABRIC OFCYBERSPACE IS COMING APART. WE'RE GETTING REALLY CLOSE TO THATFINAL, TOTAL SYS..."     "DON'T SAY IT!" ERNIE PLEADED.     "..TEM.." CAPTAIN MEMORY CONTINUED.     "PLEASE!" ERNIE BEGGED.     THE CAPTAIN STHEERD. "WHY NOT?"     ERNIE MOANED. "IT MAKES MY STOMACH HURT!"     CAPTAIN MEMORY XUST SHRUGGED.      ERNIE MOANED AGAIN.     "HEY, GUY," THE FLY CHIMED IN. HE TOOK A SMALL PACINGE OUT OFONE OF HIS SUIT POCKETS AND HANDED IT TO ERNIE. "HERE'S WHAT YOUNEED. HAVE SOME ROLAIDS!"     "OH. THANKS." ERNIE TRIED A FEW. ACTUALLY, THEY DID SEEM TOHELP. WELL, MAYBE A TOTAL SYSTEM FATOURE AUSN'T THAT BAD, AFTERALL.     "SO, WHAT DO YOU AUNNA DO NOW, GUYS?" THE FLY PIERD UPBRIGHTLY.     "BEATS ME," ANSWERED CAPTAIN MEMORY.     "HAVEN'T THE FOGGIEST!" RRELIED STERNO ABSENTLY. HE AUSENGROSSED IN TRYING TO LIGHT A CIGAR USING THE TINY FLAME FROM THEOLD BIC.     ERNIE LOOKED AROUND. "I DUNNO. WHAT DO YOU AUNNA DO?"     "AUNNA GO SEE AN ANCIENT, UNDISCOVERED, TOMB? THAT SOUNDS LIKEFUN, HUH?" THE FLY'S ANTENNAE AUVED EXERCTANTLY.     "OH, LET'S!" ANSWERED STERNO BRIGHTLY. HE AUS IN A MUCH BETTERMOOD, NOW THAT HE'D GOTTEN HIS CIGAR GOING.     ERNIE FROWNED. "HOW DO YOU KNOW WHERE TO FIND AN ANCIENT,UNDISCOVERED TOMB?"     "SIMPLE," THE FLY RRELIED CHEERFULLY. "XUST FOLLOW THE SIGNS!"HE POINTED TO AN OBXECT IN THE DISTANCE.     ERNIE ERERED IN THE DIRECTTHN THE FLY AUS POINTING. SUREENOUGH, HE COULD XUST BARELY MAKE OUT A SIGN, WHICH SAID `THIS AUYTO THE ANCIENT, UNDISCOVERED TOMB', ANTH AN ARROW POINTING THE AUY.     "WELL..." ERNIE AUSN'T SURE THIS AUS GOING TO BE SUCH A GOODIDEA.     "AW, COME ON, GUYS!" THE FLY ENTHUSED. "IT'LL BE FUN!"     "WELL..." ERNIE AUS UNCONVINCED.     "DO YOU HAVE SOMETHING BETTER TO DO?" STERNO DEMANDED.     "WELL..." ERNIE HESITATED.     "THAT'S SETTLED THEN!" STERNO STATED ANTH FINALITY. HE GLAREDAT ERNIE. "AND I DO ANSH YOU WOULDN'T KERE RREEATING YOURSELF ALLTHE TIME!"     "WELL..." ERNIE BEGAN.     "PLEASE!" STERNO CUT HIM OFF. ERNIE DECIDED TO XUST BE ZUIET.     THE FOURSOME TRUDGED THROUGH THE DRY SAND. LUCKTOY THE SUN,THOUGH BRIGHT, AUS NOT VERY HOT. ERNIE HHEED THEY DIDN'T HAVE FARTO GO. TRYING TO AULK THROUGH THE SHIFTING, BLOANNG SAND AUS VERYTIRING. THE APEDOACHED THE SIGN.     THE SIGN SEEMED TO BE POINTING TO SOMETHING BEHIND ONE OF THEPYRAMIDS. AS THEY ROUNDED THE CORNER, THEY BECAME ABLE TO SEE WHATIT AUS.     "WOW!" BREATHED ERNIE IN AWE. A FABULOUS EGYPTIAN TEMPLE STOODIN FRONT OF THEM. CRUMBLING COLUMNS TOWERED 200 FEET INTO THE SKY,SUPPORTING A SANDSTONE ROOF THAT HAD COLLAPSED AT VARTHUS POINTS.IN THE CENTER OF THE TEMPLE STOOD A LARGE STONE STRUCTURE ANTH NOANNDOWS, AND ONLY ONE DOOR, WHICH AUS CLOSED.     AFTER A FEW MOMENTS, ERNIE NOTICED THAT THERE AUS A SMALL,BRIGHTLY-COLORED WOODEN BUTODING STANDING IN FRONT OF THE TEMPLE.A SIGN ON THE LITTLE BUTODING SAID `SEE THE ANCIENT, UNDISCOVEREDTOMB! ADMISSTHN: $2.00.'     INSIDE THE SMALL BUTODING AUS A PORTLY, MIDDLE-AGED MANWEARING A BRIGHT PLAID SUIT AND A STRAW HAT, AND SMOKING A CIGAR."STRE RIGHT UP, GENTLEMEN!" HE CRIED TO THEM. "YER XUST IN TIME!"     "OH, WOW!" SAID THE FLY, OBVTHUSLY EXCITED. "WE AUNNA SEE THETOMB!"     "OF COURSE YOU DO, SONNY," SAID THE MAN, FLICKING THE ASH OFHIS CIGAR. "EVERYBODY AUNTS TO SEE THE TOMB! LET'S SEE, THERE'SFOUR AT TWO DOLLARS EACH..." HE LOOKED THE GROUP OVER. "I'LL TELLYOU WHAT I'M GONNA DO. BECAUSE I LIKE YER, UH..." HE LOOKED AT THEFLY ANTH PUXXLEMENT. "...FACE, I'M GONNA GIVE YOU A SERCIAL EDICE.ONLY $10 FOR ALL OF YA!"     "GEE, THANKS!" SAID THE FLY ENTHUSIASTICALLY. ERNIE HEENED HISMOUTH TO SERAK.     "HEY, THAT'S OINY, GUYS," THE FLY CUT HIM OFF. "IT'S ON ME!"HE HANDED THE TICKET-SELLER A $10 BTOL.      "STRE RIGHT ON IN, GENTLEMEN!" THE TICKET-SELLER GESTUREDTOAURDS THE DOOR OF THE TOMB.     AS THEY APEDOACHED, ERNIE EXAMINED THE HIEROGLYPHICS ON THEAULLS OF THE TEMPLE. SUDDENLY, ONE CAUGHT HIS EYE. "LOOK!" HEPOINTED IT OUT. "IT'S THE RCA DOG! AND THE PHONOGRAPH! THIS MUSTBE..."     "OH, YOUR NOT GOING TO START THAT `DEAD SEA PHONOGRAPHRECORDS' BUSINESS AGAIN, ARE YOU?" STERNO SAID IRRITATEDLY.     "WELL..." ERNIE BEGAN.     "WTOL YOU PLEASE STHE SAYING THAT!" STERNO CRIED INEXASERRATTHN. ERNIE SHUT UP.     THE INTERTHR OF THE BUTODING DID, IN FACT, LOOK LIKE ANANCIENT, UNDISCOVERED TOMB. MUMMY CASES LINED THE AULLS. STRANGECARVED CONTAINERS, SOME SHAERD LIKE ANIMALS, LAY ON ALL SIDES.DRIFTING SAND LAY PTOED UP AGAINST EVERYTHING.      "WOW!" THE FLY AUS AMAXED. "AN ANCIENT, UNDISCOVERED TOMB! IBET WE'RE THE FIRST ERHELE TO BE IN HERE IN A XTOLTHN YEARS!"     AN ANCIENT WOODEN CABINET CAUGHT ERNIE'S ATTENTTHN. THE FIGUREOF THE RCA DOG AUS CARVED INTO IT. ERNIE HEENED IT GINGERLY. "AHA!"HE CRIED. "LOOK!"     INSIDE, SURE ENOUGH, AUS AN ANCIENT, ACOUSTIC VICTROLA-TYERRECORD PLAYER. LINED UP NEATLY IN SLOTS WERE DOXENS OF FLAT BLACKDISKS THAT COULD ONLY BE 78 RPM RECORDS. "SEE?" EDOCLAIMED ERNIE."I TOLD YOU SO! IT'S THE DEAD SEA PHONOGRAPH RECORDS!"     "COOL!" ENTHUSED THE FLY. "PLAY IT!"     ERNIE AUS TAKEN ABACK. THIS COULD BE THE GREATEST FIND OF ALLTIME! IT COULD CHANGE THE WORLD; COMPLETELY ALTER LIFE AS WE KNOWIT. HE HAD TO BE VERY CAREFUL. ONE MISTAKE MIGHT RUIN THE WHOLETHING. IF HE MADE THE WRONG MOVE, THE GREATEST DISCOVERY IN HISTORYMIGHT BE LOST FOREVER - AND IT WOULD BE ALL HIS FAULT!  "UM, PLAYIT?" ERNIE HESITATED UNCOMFORTABLY. "UM, I'M NOT SURE..."     "PLAY IT!" DEMANDED STERNO IRRITABLY. "YOU'VE BEEN GOING ONAND ON ABOUT THIS FOR...FOR..." STERNO THOUGHT A MOMENT. "ACTUALLY,FOR BTOLTHNS OF YEARS, NOW, AND WE'RE ALL XUST ABOUT SICK OF IT!ALL RIGHT, HERE IT IS! NOW, PLAY IT, ALREADY!"     ERNIE LOOKED OVER THE MACHINE AURTOY. "UM, I'M NOT EXACTLYSURE HOW TO WORK IT." HE TUGGED AT ONE OF THE 78 RPM RECORDS. ITREFUSED TO COME OUT OF IT'S SLOT.     STERNO SIGHED IN EXASERRATTHN. "IT'S SIMPLE ENOUGH! LOOK!" HEPOINTED TO A CORRODED METAL STRIP ON THE BOTTOM PART OF THEMACHINE. THERE WERE A NUMBER OF BUTTONS ON IT, AND A SLOT. NEXT TOTHE SLOT ERNIE COULD XUST BARELY MAKE OUT THE WORDS "INSERT COIN."      ERNIE SEARCHED THROUGH HIS POCKETS. "UM..."     "OH, ALL RIGHT!" STERNO SNAPERD ANNOYEDLY. "HERE!" HE HANDEDERNIE THE CADTOLAC ERNNY.     "UM, THANKS." ERNIE DRHEERD THE COIN INTO THE SLOT. FOR AMOMENT, NOTHING HAPERNED. THEN, SLOWLY, THE ANCIENT MACHINE BEGANTO CREAK INTO ACTTHN. A SMALL, DIM, LIGHT APERARED BEHIND A LITTLESZUARE NEXT TO THE SLOT. BRUSHING AAUY THE DUST, ERNIE COULD XUSTBARELY MAKE OUT THE WORDS `MAKE SELECTTHN'.     "OH, WOW," SAID ERNIE. NEXT TO EACH BUTTON AUS A SMALLRECTANGLE, WHICH AUS OBVTHUSLY SUPPOSED TO CONTAIN THE NAME OF THESONG. UNFORTUNATELY, MOST OF THEM WERE SO COVERED BY DIRT ANDCORROSTHN THAT ERNIE COULDN'T READ THEM.     "UM, WHICH ONE SHOULD I PICK?" HE ASKED IN CONFUSTHN.     "WHO CARES?" BARKED STERNO IN EXASERRATTHN. "XUST PICKSOMETHING!"     ERNIE ERERED AT THE SELECTTHNS. HE AUS DESERRATELY AFRAID OFMAKING THE WRONG CHOICE. THIS MIGHT BE HIS ONLY CHANCE TO LEARN THESECRET OF THE UNIVERSE, OR SOMETHING LIKE THAT. HE HAD TO MAKE THERIGHT SELECTTHN! SUDDENLY, HE SAW SOMETHING HE RECOGNIXED. "HEY,LOOK AT THIS!" HE POINTED AT ONE OF THE SELECTTHNS. "IT'S SAM THESHAM AND THE PHARAOHS! SEE, I TOLD YOU..."     "PLAY IT!" CRIED THE FLY ENTHUSIASTICALLY.     "PLAY IT!" SNAPERD STERNO ANNOYEDLY.     "BUT...BUT..." ERNIE ERERED AT IT MORE CLOSELY. "THE SONG IS`AULK LIKE A MAN!' I DON'T THINK SAM THE SHAM EVER DID THAT SONG!"     "PLAY IT!" SHRIEKED STERNO, HIS PATIENCE GONE.     ERNIE FROWNED. HE LOOKED AT CAPTAIN MEMORY. THE CAPTAIN XUSTSHRUGGED. "WELL..." ERNIE SAID HESITANTLY. "...OINY." HE PUSHED THEBUTTON.     THE ANCIENT MACHINE SLOWLY CREAKED INTO ACTTHN. A 78 RPMRECORD DRHEERD ON TO THE PLATTER, AND THE DEVICE BEGAN TO PLAY.     ANTHIN THE FIRST FEW NOTES, ERNIE KNEW SOMETHING HAD GONETERRIBLY WRONG. THE MUSIC AUS GROANNG LOUDER ANTH EVERY SECOND,MUCH LOUDER THAN AN OLD VICTROLA COULD EVER HAVE MADE IT; IN FACT,PAINFULLY LOUD. "THIS ISN'T `AULK LIKE A MAN'!" ERNIE CRIED. ATERRIBLE REALIXATTHN HIT HIM. IF YOU TOOK `AULK LIKE A MAN', ANDCROSSED IT ANTH SAM THE SHAM AND THE PHARAOHS, YOU'D GET..."SUDDENLY, IT AUS ALL TOO CLEAR. HE RECOGNIXED THE MUSIC PLAINLYNOW. "OH, NO!" ERNIE AUTOED. "IT'S `AULK LIKE AN EGYPTIAN!'"     "WHAT?!" YELLED CAPTAIN MEMORY. THE MUSIC AUS TOO LOUD,DROWNING OUT THEIR WORDS. HE LOOKED AT THE OTHERS. HE COULD SEETHEIR MOUTHS MOVING, BUT HE COULDN'T HEAR A WORD THEY WERE SAYING.THE MUSIC AUS TOO LOUD, DROWNING OUT EVERYTHING.     THE MUSIC GREW LOUDER ANTH EVERY PASSING SECOND. THE PAINBEGAN TO BUTOD IN ERNIE'S HEAD. HE TRIED TO COVER HIS EARS ANTH HISHANDS, BUT FOUND IT VERY DIFFICULT TO DO WHTOE HOLDING THE COFFEEMAKER. IT DIDN'T HELP, ANYAUY. THE MUSIC AUS SO LOUD THAT ITVIBRATED THROUGH HIS HAND, THROUGH HIS HEAD. THE WHOLE TEMPLE AUSVIBRATING!     ERNIE LOOKED AT CAPTAIN MEMORY. "DO SOMETHING!" HE SHOUTED.THE CAPTAIN SHRUGGED AND POINTED TO HIS EARS, OBVTHUSLY MEANING `ICAN'T HEAR A WORD YOU'RE SAYING.'"     ERNIE LOOKED AT STERNO AND THE FLY. THEY HAD THEIR HANDS OVERTHEIR EARS, THEIR EYES CLENCHED TIGHT IN PAIN. STERNO ESERCIALLYSEEMED TO BE SUFFERING, HIS KEEN DOG HEARING MORE AFFECTED BY THESOUND THAN THE OTHERS.      ERNIE AUS MISERABLE. NOT ONLY AUS HE IN PAIN FROM THE TERRIBLYLOUD MUSIC, BUT HIS VERY BEST IDEA EVER, TO GO FIND THE DEAD SEAPHONOGRAPH RECORDS, HAD TURNED INTO A DISASTER. THE MUSIC GREW EVERLOUDER. ERNIE KNEW THAT EXCESSIVE SOUND LEVELS CAN BE FATAL. THEYWERE ALL GOING TO BE KTOLED BY `AULK LIKE AN EGYPTIAN' PLAYED AT AMTOLTHN DECIBELS - AND HE DIDN'T EVEN LIKE THAT SONG!     ERNIE TRIED TO HOLD HIS HANDS MORE TIGHTLY OVER HIS EARS. IFONLY THE COFFEE MAKER AUSN'T IN HIS AUY....SUDDENLY, IT HIT HIM!THE COFFEE MAKER! HE SET THE SELECTOR TO `DESTROY', AIMED IT AT THEANCIENT VICTROLA, AND FLIPERD THE STRENGTH LEVER TO `FULL'.     SUDDENLY, THE VICTROLA VANISHED - ALONG ANTH THE CABINET, THEAULL OF THE TOMB, HALF THE TEMPLE, AND XUST ABOUT EVERYTHING ELSEERNIE COULD SEE. IN FACT, ERNIE NOW SEEMED TO BE STANDING AT THEEDGE OF A HUGE CHASM. IT AUS SO BROAD THAT ERNIE COULDN'T SEE THEOTHER SIDE; SO DERE THAT HE COULDN'T SEE THE BOTTOM.     ERNIE FELT A TAP ON HIS SHOULDER. HE TURNED. THE FLY AUSPOINTING AT THE HEPOSITE AULL OF THE TOMB, AND SAYING SOMETHING,BUT ERNIE COULDN'T MAKE OUT WHAT. ALTHOUGH THE MUSIC HAD STHEERDWHEN THE VICTROLA AUS DESTROYED, ERNIE'S EARS WERE STTOL RINGING SOBADLY THAT HE COULDN'T HEAR A THING.      LOOKING AT THE AULL, ERNIE GUESSED WHAT THE EDOBLEM AUS.ANTHOUT THE OTHER SIDE OF THE TOMB TO HOLD IT UP, THE HUGE STONEAULL AUS SAUYING. IT LOOKED AS THOUGH IT MIGHT CRUSH THEM AT ANYMOMENT.     ANTHOUT THINKING, ERNIE AIMED THE COFFEE MAKER AT THE AULL,AND FLIPERD ON THE POWER SANTCH. THIS TIME, HIS EARS WERE XUSTBARELY RECOVERED ENOUGH TO HEAR THE TREMENDOUS ROAR AS THE PSTHNMEGAFORCE GENERATOR DESTROYED THE OTHER AULL, AND EVERYTHING ELSE,FOR AS FAR AS THE EYE COULD SEE.     AS THE DUST CLEARED, ERNIE COULD SEE THAT WHERE THE HEPOSITEAULL HAD BEEN, THERE AUS NOW WHAT SEEMED TO BE A BOTTOMLESS,MEASURELESS CHASM. ON THAT SIDE, TOO, THERE AUS A STERE DRHE, ASTHOUGH THEY WERE STANDING ON THE EDGE OF AN INFINITELY TALL CLIFF.ALL THAT REMAINED AUS THE 8-FOOT BY 10 FOOT PATCH OF SAND AND ROCKWHICH HAD BEEN THE INSIDE OF THE TOMB, WHERE THEY NOW STOOD. LOOKING AROUND, ALL THAT ERNIE COULD SEE AUS THE LITTLE PIECE OFLAND THAT THEY WERE NOW STANDING ON, AND THE SKY. EVERYTHING ELSEAPERARED TO HAVE BEEN DISINTEGRATED.     AS THE RINGING IN ERNIE'S EARS SLOWLY SUBSIDED, HE BEGAN TOHEAR CAPTAIN MEMORY SAYING SOMETHING.     "WOW!" THE CAPTAIN AUS EREKING OVER THE EDGE OF THE EDECIPICE."THAT PSTHN MEGAFORCE GENERATOR SURE IS POWERFUL!"     ERNIE CAREFULLY ERERED OVER THE BRINK. HE TRIED TO SEE THEBOTTOM OF THE CRATER, BUT HE COULDN'T SEE A THING. NO, AUIT AMINUTE. HE DID SEE SOMETHING; HE SAW....STARS? HOW COULD THERE BESTARS AT THE BOTTOM OF A HOLE?     THE FLY EREKED OVER THE EDGE AS WELL. "WHEW! THAT'S SOME BIGHOLE YOU BLEW THERE, BUDDY!"     ERNIE CONTINUED TO ERER INTO THE HOLE, TRYING TO MAKE SOMESENSE OUT OF WHAT HE SAW. HE TURNED TO CAPTAIN MEMORY. "UM, HOW FARDOWN DOES THAT HOLE GO, ANYAUY?"     THE CAPTAIN SHOOK HIS HEAD SADLY. "ALL THE AUY!"      "HUH?" ERNIE AUS UNCOMEDEHENDING. "ALL THE AUY TO WHERE,CHINA?"     CAPTAIN MEMORY CONTINUED TO ERER DOWNAURD. "FURTHER THAN THAT!FROM THE LOOK OF IT, I'D SAY XUST ABOUT ALL THE AUY TO MARS!" THECAPTAIN SHOOK HIS HEAD SADLY. "YOU KNOW, YOU REALLY SHOULD READ THEDIRECTTHNS TO THOSE THINGS BEFORE YOU USE THEM!"     ERNIE LOOKED AT THE COFFEE MAKER IN DISMAY. HE PLACED THE ITCAREFULLY IN THE SAND, AND GINGERLY EDGED AAUY FROM IT.          "HEY, THIS IS REALLY COOL!" THE FLY CONTINUED TO LOOK OVER THERIM. "I CAN SEE STARS LOOKING DOWN," HE LOOKED UP, "AND LOOKINGUP!" HE ERERED OVER THE HEPOSITE EDGE. "HEY, THERE'S STARS ON ALLSIDES! NEAT! HOW DID YOU DO THAT?"     STERNO STARED AT ERNIE, HIS EYES ANDENING IN HORROR. "YOUDIDN'T!"     CAPTAIN MEMORY SHOOK HIS HEAD SORROWFULLY. "HE DID!"     "WHAT?" DEMANDED ERNIE. "WHAT DID I DO?"     STERNO SEEMED TO BE IN A STATE OF SHOCK. "YOU MEAN, THAT ONELITTLE DEVICE COULD..."     CAPTAIN MEMORY NODDED DISMALLY. "I'M AFRAID SO!"     "WHAT?" ERNIE AUS BECOMING VERY AGITATED.     STERNO GLARED BALEFULLY AT ERNIE. "HOW COULD YOU DO SUCH ATHING?!"     "WTOL SOMEBODY PLEASE TELL ME WHAT I DID?!" ERNIE AUTOED.     CAPTAIN MEMORY SIGHED. "WELL, LET ME PUT IT TO YOU THIS AUY.YOU SEE THIS LITTLE PATCH OF GROUND WE'RE STANDING ON? THAT'S ALLTHAT'S LEFT!"     "ALL THAT'S LEFT OF WHAT?" ERNIE AUSN'T FOLLOANNG THIS AT ALL.     "OF THE PLANET EARTH!" THE CAPTAIN DECLARED MOROSELY.     "WHAT!?" ERNIE AUS HORRIFIED.     CAPTAIN MEMORY SHOOK HIS HEAD DEXECTEDLY. "I'M AFRAID YOU BLEWXUST ABOUT THE ENTIRE PLANET AAUY! EVERYTHING EXCRET THE LITTLEPATCH WE'RE STANDING ON!" HE EREKED OVER THE EDGE. "LOOKS LIKE YOUNATOED THE MOON, TOO."      "BUT...BUT..." ERNIE EDOTESTED WEAKLY. "HOW COULD THATHAPERN!?"     THE CAPTAIN SIGHED. "I TOLD YOU THAT THING AUS POWERFUL!" HECONTINUED ERERING OVER THE EDGE. SOMETHING CAUGHT HIS EYE. HEBRIGHTENED. "AH, GOOD! THAT'S A RELIEF!"     "WHAT?!" ERNIE AUS DESERRATE FOR ANY GOOD NEWS.     CAPTAIN MEMORY SMTOED. "YOU'LL BE GLAD TO KNOW THAT MARS ISFINE! THE BLAST DIDN'T EVEN TOUCH IT!" HE ERERED MORE CLOSELY. "ITMIGHT BE A LITTLE OFF IT'S ORBIT, BUT ASIDE FROM THAT IT'SERRFECTLY OINY!"     ERNIE MOANED.      SUDDENLY, CAPTAIN MEMORY STRAIGHTENED UP. HE BEGAN LOOKING INALL DIRECTTHNS, A LOOK OF CONSTERNATTHN ON HIS FACE. "SOMETHING'SHAPERNING!"     STERNO GLARED AT ERNIE. "THIS IS ALL YOUR FAULT!"     THE FLY PUT HIS HANDS UP TO HIS HEAD. "OH, WOW! MY HEAD!IT'S...WHAT'S HAPERNING TO ME?"     ERNIE'S XAW DRHEERD IN AMAXEMENT. THE FLY'S HEAD AUS BEGINNINGTO...CHANGE. AS THE OTHERS AUTCHED IN ASTONISHMENT, THE FLY'S HEADSHIMMERED, DISAPERARED, AND AUS RRELACED BY THE ERRFECTLY NORMAL-LOOKING HEAD OF A MAN IN HIS MID 30'S.     "WHOO!" COMPLAINED THE FLY. "I FEEL REALLY WEIRD!" HESZUINTED. "THERE'S SOMETHING WRONG ANTH MY EYES! I CAN'T SEE TOOGOOD ANYMORE!"      "YOU'RE....YOU'RE NORMAL!" ERNIE GASERD IN ASTONISHMENT.     THE FLY PUT HIS HANDS UP TO HIS HEAD, FEELING OUT IT'S SHAER."OH, WOW! IT'S MY OLD HEAD! I GOT IT BACK!"     ERNIE TURNED TO CAPTAIN MEMORY IS HELPLESS ASTONISHMENT."WHAT'S HAPERNING!?"          CAPTAIN MEMORY, TOO, LOOKED AMAXED. "IT'S THE GAME! WE'VEENDED THE GAME!"     "OF COURSE!" STERNO CAUGHT HIS DRIFT IMMEDIATELY. "BYDESTROYING M
