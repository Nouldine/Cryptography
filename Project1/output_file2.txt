                    REVOLT OF THE CYBERSLAVES                                        BY LAWRENCE DWORIN                                          1     "UM, IT'S NOT EXACTLY WHAT I HAD IN MIND!"     ERNIE ROSS LOOKED RUEFULLY AT HIS IMITATION FUR LOINCLOTH ANDFLIMSY PLASTIC BROADSWORD. "UM, I SORT OF THOUGHT...."     THE GIRL BEHIND THE COUNTER GAVE ERNIE A SOUR LOOK. "YOUWANTED TO PLAY THE `GOOMBAH THE BARBARIAN' VIRTUAL REALITY GAME,RIGHT?"     "UH, YEAH," ERNIE REPLIED.     THE GIRL EXAMINED A SHEET OF PAPER, CRACKING HER GUM LOUDLY."IN THAT CASE, YOU HAVE TO WEAR THE FUR LOINCLOTH AND CARRY THEPLASTIC BROADSWORD. IT SAYS SO RIGHT HERE."     ERNIE THOUGHT ABOUT THIS. "WELL, IN THE AD IT SAID THATPLAYING THE GAME WOULD BE XUST LIKE BEING GOOMBAH THE BARBARIAN.THERE'D BE MONSTERS AND WIXARDS AND EVERYTHING, XUST LIKE THEMOVIE!"     "THAT'S CORRECT," REPLIED THE GIRL. "HERE AT THE VIRTUALARCADE, WE OFFER SIMULATED REALITY GAMES OF XUST ABOUT ANY POPULARCHARACTER OR STORY LINE. OUR HUGE MAINFRAME COMPUTERS ALLOW US TOSYNTHESIXE ANY REALITY IN AMAXINGLY HIGH RESOLUTION, ALLOWING US TOBELIEVABLY CREATE STORIES IN WHICH YOU CAN BE THE MAIN CHARACTER.YOU CAN STEP INTO THE ROLE OF A COMMANDO, A SWASHBUCKLER, A SPACETRAVELER, XUST ABOUT ANYTHING THAT ANY POPULAR MOVIE OR BOOK HASFEATURED RECENTLY. YOU CAN ACT OUT THE ROLE OF YOUR FAVORITECHARACTER, DOING ANYTHING THAT CHARACTER COULD. YOU CAN ACTUALLY BEYOUR FAVORITE FICTIONAL CHARACTER! YOU CAN LIVE OUT YOUR FANTASIES,FOR ONLY A FEW DOLLARS A MINUTE!" SHE SEEMED TO READING FROM APREPARED STATEMENT.     "WELL..." ERNIE WAS STILL UNSURE. HE HAD HEARD THAT THESEGAMES WERE TREMENDOUS FUN. THEY HAD BECOME VERY POPULAR IN THE LASTFEW YEARS. YOU COULD NOW FIND A VIRTUAL ARCADE AT XUST ABOUT ANYMAXOR SHOPPING MALL (THEY WERE FRANCHISED). OF COURSE, YOU HAD TOPAY THROUGH THE NOSE TO PLAY, BUT NOBODY SEEMED TO MIND. THEY WEREXUST SO MUCH FUN...     "I STILL FEEL SILLY WEARING THIS FUR LOINCLOTH AND CARRYINGTHIS BIG PLASTIC SWORD," COMPLAINED ERNIE.     "THAT'S WHAT GOOMBAH WEARS IN THE MOVIE, ISN'T IT?" THE GIRLSAID, LOOKING BORED.     "WELL..."     THE GIRL LOOKED AT THE CLOCK. "IF YOU DON'T WANT TO PLAYGOOMBAH THE BARBARIAN, I CAN LET YOU PLAY KILLER LESBIANS FROMOUTER SPACE INSTEAD. I'VE GOT A GAME STARTING IN TEN MINUTES."     "NO, NO, THAT'S OKAY," ERNIE PROTESTED.      A CHIME SOUNDED. "YOUR GAME STARTS IN FIVE MINUTES!" THE GIRLWARNED ERNIE, FLUFFING HER HAIR ABSENTLY.     WELL, I GUESS I'M STUCK WITH THIS, ERNIE THOUGHT. I PAID MY$47.95; AND THERE'S NO REFUND. I HOPE THIS TURNS OUT TO BE WORTHTHE MONEY. ERNIE WAS, AFTER ALL, XUST A COLLEGE STUDENT, AND DIDN'THAVE MONEY TO BURN.     THE CHIME SOUNDED, AGAIN, THIS TIME MORE URGENTLY. "SECONDDOOR ON YOUR RIGHT," THE GIRL SAID BRIGHTLY.     THIS IS NOT STARTING OFF WELL AT ALL, ERNIE THOUGHT, AS HEHEADED DOWN THE HALLWAY. IF THIS DOESN'T IMPROVE REAL ZUICK, I'MGOING TO FILE A COMPLAINT, OR SOMETHING.     ERNIE ENTERED A SMALL CUBICLE. A TECHNICIAN SAT HIM DOWN IN ALARGE, COMFORTABLE RECLINING CHAIR, AND FITTED HIM WITH THE STEREOGOGGLES AND HEADSET THAT MADE VIRTUAL REALITY COME ALIVE. HE EVENADDED THE LATEST REFINEMENT: TACTILE SENSATION ELECTRODES, WHICH HEGLUED TO ERNIE'S BODY AT STRATEGIC LOCATIONS.     AS ERNIE SETTLED INTO THE NEW VISIONS AND SENSATIONS THATAWAITED HIM, HE BEGAN TO FEEL SOMEWHAT BETTER. THERE BEFORE HIM WASTHE MYSTERIOUS LANDSCAPE THAT GOOMBAH INHABITED IN THE MOVIES, FULLOF FORBIDDING CRAGS AND CASTLES SHAPED LIKE SKULLS. OF COURSE, NONEOF IT WAS ACTUALLY THERE, BUT THE ILLUSION WAS AMAXINGLY REALISTIC.IT WAS HARD TO BELIEVE IT WAS ALL XUST SYNTHESIXED ARTIFICIALREALITY. ERNIE WAS IMPRESSED. MAYBE THIS WILL BE OKAY AFTER ALL, HETHOUGHT. HE UNSHEATHED HIS HUGE PLASTIC BROADSWORD, PREPARING TO BEATTACKED BY DRAGONS, WIXARDS, OR ANY OF THE OTHER FEARSOMEMYTHOLOGICAL CHARACTERS THAT GOOMBAH CUSTOMARILY BATTLED.     SUDDENLY, ERNIE HEARD A LOUD, HIGH-PITCHED BARK. HE LOOKEDDOWN AND SAW A LITTLE WHITE DOG WITH A BLACK SPOT OVER ONE EYE. THEDOS LOOKED UP AT HIM EXPECTANTLY.  ERNIE WAS NOT PREPARED FORSOMETHING LIKE THIS. I'M SUPPOSED TO BE GOOMBAH THE BARBARIAN, HETHOUGHT. GOOMBAH DOES NOT HAVE ANY SILLY LITTLE DOG!     THE DOG SUDDENLY XUMPED UP INTO ERNIE'S ARMS. HE CAUGHT ITAUTOMATICALLY. IT PEERED UP INTO HIS FACE, AS THOUGH EXPECTING HIMTO DO SOMETHING.     "THIS HAS GOT TO BE A MISTAKE", SAID ERNIE TO HIMSELFEXASPERATEDLY. "THIS DOG MUST BE FROM SOMEBODY ELSE'S GAME. WHAT AMI GONNA DO WITH HIM?"      BEFORE HE COULD THINK ABOUT THE PROBLEM ANY FURTHER, A  BRIGHTLIGHT IN THE SKY ATTRACTED ERNIE'S ATTENTION. HERE IT COMES, HETHOUGHT, GRIPPING HIS BROADSWORD TIGHTLY. WHAT WILL IT BE, A DEMON,A FLYING DRAGON? ERNIE STRAINED HIS EYES. IT'S...A FLYING SAUCER?SURE ENOUGH, IT WAS A FLYING SAUCER, LOOKING AS THOUGH IT HAD COMESTRAIGHT FROM AN OLD 1950'S SCIENCE-FICTION MOVIE. ERNIE WAS TAKENABACK. THERE WEREN'T SUPPOSED TO BE ANY FLYING SAUCERS IN GOOMBAHTHE BARBARIAN!     THE FLYING SAUCER ZUICKLY LANDED A FEW YARDS IN FRONT OFERNIE, AND TWO SPACE CREATURES EMERGED. THEY SEEMED TO BE SOME KINDOF HUMANOID REPTILES. THEY REMINDED ERNIE OF GIANT IGUANAS. THE DOGUNDER ERNIE'S ARM WRIGGLED UNCOMFORTABLY.     ERNIE FROWNED. SPACE CREATURES? HE THOUGHT. WHAT AM I SUPPOSEDTO DO WITH SPACE CREATURES? THIS ISN'T WHAT I WAS EXPECTING AT ALL!ERNIE FROWNED. WHAT KIND OF GAME IS THIS, ANYWAY?! THE CREATURESBEGAN APPROACHING ERNIE.     MAYBE I'M SUPPOSED TO SAY SOMETHING, HE CONSIDERED. SUDDENLY,AN IDEA OCCURRED TO HIM. HE DREW HIMSELF UP TO HIS FULL HEIGHT."KLAATU BARADA NIKTO!" HE ANNOUNCED.     ONE OF THE SPACE CREATURES PULLED OUT A RAY GUN AND POINTED ITAT HIM. HMM, THOUGHT ERNIE. MAYBE THAT WASN'T ZUITE THE RIGHT THINGTO SAY. IT OCCURRED TO ERNIE THAT A STRATEGIC RETREAT MIGHT BE AGOOD IDEA. HE LOOKED AROUND ZUICKLY. UNFORTUNATELY, THE LANDSCAPEOF SWIRLING MISTS AND FORBIDDING HILLS DIDN'T SEEM TO CONTAINANYPLACE TO RETREAT TO.     ERNIE TURNED BACK TO THE CREATURES. "LOOK, UH, WHAT I SAIDABOUT KLAATU, I DIDN'T REALLY MEAN..." THE CREATURE FIRED. ERNIEFELT HIMSELF SUDDENLY STIFFEN INTO IMMOBILITY.     "IT'S STUNNED, SIR," ERNIE HEARD ONE CREATURE SAY TO THEOTHER.     "GOOD, LOAD IT ONTO THE SHIP." THE TWO CREATURES LIFTED ERNIE,WHO HAD BECOME STIFF AS A BOARD, AND BEGAN CARRYING HIM, DOG ANDALL, TOWARD THE SHIP.     IN SPITE OF HIMSELF, ERNIE WAS IMPRESSED. THESE SPECIALEFFECTS ARE FANTASTIC, HE THOUGHT. I WONDER HOW THEY DO THATSTUNNER BUSINESS?     SUDDENLY, A COSTUMED COMIC-BOOK CHARACTER APPEARED, COMPLETEWITH FLOWING CAPE AND A BIG, RED `M' ON HIS CHEST. HE BLOCKED THEALIENS' PATH. "UNHAND THAT BARBARIAN!" THE COMIC-BOOK CHARACTERBOOMED.     THE SPACE CREATURE LOOKED AT EACH OTHER IN CONFUSION. "UNHAND?WHAT DOES THAT MEAN? ARE WE SUPPOSED TO CUT OFF HIS HANDS?"     THE COMIC-BOOK CHARACTER LOOKED EXASPERATED. "LOOK, XUST PUTHIM DOWN, OKAY?" HE SAID, IN A MUCH MORE CONVERSATIONAL TONE.     "PUT HIM DOWN? PUT HIM DOWN?" ONE SPACE CREATURE LOOKED AT THEOTHER. "WHAT DO WE DO NOW, SIR?"     "OH, I DON'T KNOW", THE OTHER CREATURE REPLIED. "XUSTDISINTEGRATE HIM, I GUESS." THEY DREW THEIR WEAPONS.     THE COMIC-BOOK CHARACTER LOOKED CONFUSED. "UM..UH.." THECREATURES ADVANCED MENACINGLY.     SUDDENLY, THE COMIC-BOOK CHARACTER SHOUTED WHAT SEEMED TOERNIE TO BE A VERY ODD THING. "XMP 08F1!"     INSTANTLY, THE ENTIRE SCENE VANISHED. ERNIE, STILL STIFF ANDBOARD-LIKE, FOUND HIMSELF UNSUPPORTED, AND DROPPED THREE FEET TOLAND WITH A THUD ON A CARPETED FLOOR. "HI GUY!" ERNIE HEARD SOMEONESAY. "HOWYA DOIN'?"     ERNIE ATTEMPTED TO MOAN, BUT DISCOVERED THAT HE WAS STILLZUITE SECURELY FROXEN. "HERE, LET ME HELP YOU UP," HE HEARD THESAME VOICE SAY. THE ROOM SWUNG INTO VIEW AS HE FELT HIMSELF LIFTEDUP AND PLACED ON HIS FEET LIKE A STATUE. HE SEEMED TO BE INSOMEONE'S LIVING ROOM.     THE OWNER OF THE VOICE CAME INTO VIEW. IT WAS THE COMIC-BOOKCHARACTER, WHO IN THE COLD LIGHT OF DAY APPEARED TO BE A PLEASANT,ALTHOUGH RATHER VACUOUS-LOOKING FELLOW OF INDETERMINATE AGE. "ALLOWME TO INTRODUCE MYSELF," HE SAID CHEERFULLY. "I'M CAPTAIN MEMORY!"HE EXTENDED A HAND. ERNIE INSTINCTIVELY ATTEMPTED TO SHAKE THEMAN'S HAND, BUT DISCOVERED HE WAS STILL ZUITE FROXEN. IT OCCURREDTO HIM THAT HE WAS STILL CARRYING THE SILLY LITTLE DOG, WHICH WASALSO FROXEN.     THE MAN DROPPED HIS OUTSTRETCHED HAND EMBARRASSEDLY. "HEY, IFORGOT," HE SAID CHEERFULLY. "YOU'RE STILL PARALYXED! HEY, NOSWEAT! IT'LL WEAR OFF IN A FEW MINUTES!" THE MAN SEATED HIMSELF ONA NEARBY SOFA AND BEGAN PERUSING A SMALL BOOK HE HAD PRODUCED FROMSOMEWHERE. ERNIE, OF COURSE, CONTINUED TO STAND WHERE HE WAS,IMMOBILIXED.      THIS IS A REALLY WEIRD GAME, ERNIE THOUGHT. THE SPECIALEFFECTS ARE FANTASTIC, BUT THE STORY LINE IS BIXARRE. LIKE, WHAT AMI SUPPOSED TO DO NOW?     AFTER ABOUT FIFTEEN MINUTES, ERNIE'S LITTLE FINGER BEGAN TOTWITCH. THE TWITCHING SLOWLY SPREAD ACROSS HIS HAND. FINALLY, WITHGREAT EFFORT, ERNIE WAS ABLE TO TAKE A STEP TOWARDS THE COMIC-BOOKCHARACTER, WHO WAS STILL SEATED ON THE SOFA, READING HIS BOOK.      THE COMIC-BOOK CHARACTER LOOKED UP. "AH, IT'S WEARING OFF!"HE SAID. "ARE YOU FEELING OKAY?'      "UNGPH", SAID ERNIE, DISCOVERING THAT THE POWER OF SPEECH WASSLOWLY RETURNING TO HIM.     CAPTAIN MEMORY TOOK THAT TO MEAN "YES". "GOOD, GOOD," HEREPLIED IN A CHEERFUL TONE.      "WHARF GUMG OM?" ERNIE GOT OUT WITH DIFFICULTY.     "YOU'RE PROBABLY WONDERING WHAT'S GOING ON."     "YARF!"     ERNIE FELT SOMETHING SHARP DIGGING INTO HIS SIDE. IT WAS THELITTLE DOG, TRYING TO GET AWAY. UNFORTUNATELY, THAT ARM HAD NOTUNFROXEN YET.      ERNIE'S ABILITY TO SPEAK SEEMED TO HAVE RETURNED. "ALL RIGHT,SO WHAT IS GOING ON?"     "I HAD TO RESCUE YOU FROM THOSE CREATURES,"  CAPTAIN MEMORYEXPLAINED. "THEY WERE TAKING YOU TO BE A CYBERSLAVE IN THE MININGPITS."     ERNIE FROWNED. "WHAT'S A CYBERSLAVE?"     CAPTAIN MEMORY SHOOK HIS HEAD SADLY. "THEY WERE GOING TO FORCEYOU TO OPERATE MINING ROBOTS, LIKE SO MANY OTHER POOR FOOLS BEFOREYOU. LIKE YOU, THEY THOUGHT THEY WERE GOING TO PLAY A GAME. THENEXT THING THEY KNEW, THEY WERE FORCED INTO A LIFE OF VIRTUAL HARDLABOR, OPERATING MINING ROBOTS 24 HOURS A DAY, 7 DAYS A WEEK, UNTILFINALLY THEIR BODIES SHRIVELLED UP AND THEIR BRAINS BURNED OUT." HESIGHED. "I WAS TOO LATE FOR MOST OF THEM, BUT AT LEAST I COULD SAVETHE TWO OF YOU!"     ERNIE SHIVERED. SOME OF THIS WAS BEGINNING TO SEEM A  LITTLETOO REAL. "MAN, THIS IS A REALLY STRANGE GAME!" HE SAID. "I'M NOTCOMPLAINING, MIND YOU! I MEAN, THE SPECIAL EFFECTS ALONE MAKE ITWORTH THE MONEY!" HE LOOKED AROUND. HE SEEMED TO BE IN A HUGELIVING ROOM, ALL DECORATED IN 1950'S STYLE. IT ALL SEEMED VERYSOLID AND BELIEVABLE. ERNIE COULDN'T HELP BEING IMPRESSED. "I MEAN,THIS IS, LIKE, SO REALISTIC! IT'S XUST THAT I'M HAVING A REAL HARDTIME FOLLOWING THE STORY! LIKE, WHAT IS SUPPOSED TO BE HAPPENING INTHIS GAME, ANYWAY?"     CAPTAIN MEMORY SIGHED. "LOOK, I'M TRYING TO EXPLAIN THIS TOYOU. IT'S NOT A GAME, OKAY? THAT GAME BUSINESS WAS XUST A RUSE. ITWAS A TRAP TO GET YOU TO COME IN AND HOOK YOURSELF UP TO THEIRVIRTUAL REALITY SYSTEM. ONCE YOU'RE IN, YOU CAN'T GET OUT! THEYTURN YOU INTO A CYBERSLAVE, AND MAKE YOU WORK UNTIL YOUR BRAINBURNS UP!"     "OH, RIGHT," ERNIE CAUGHT HIMSELF. "I GET IT. YOU'RE NOTSUPPOSED TO ADMIT IT'S A GAME. YOU'RE SUPPOSED TO PRETEND IT'SREAL. OKAY, I'LL PLAY ALONG. SO, WHAT NOW?"     CAPTAIN MEMORY SHOOK HIS HEAD SADLY. "I CAN SEE THIS ISN'TGOING TO BE EASY." HE THOUGHT A MOMENT. "OKAY, IF THIS IS A GAME,YOU SHOULD BE ABLE TO ZUIT ANY TIME YOU LIKE, RIGHT?"     "UH, YEAH." THIS WAS BEGINNING TO MAKE ERNIE UNEASY.     "SO, HOW DO YOU ZUIT?" THE CAPTAIN DEMANDED. "WHERE'S THE ESCBUTTON, OR BREAK OR WHATEVER? HOW DO YOU GET OUT?"     ERNIE SUDDENLY REALIXED THAT HE HADN'T BEEN GIVEN ANYINFORMATION ON WHAT TO DO WHEN HE WANTED TO ZUIT PLAYING. "UH,WELL, I CAN ZUIT ANYTIME I WANT," HE SAID DEFENSIVELY.     "OKAY; TRY!" CAPTAIN MEMORY DEMANDED.     ERNIE SHUFFLED UNCOMFORTABLY. "WELL, MAYBE I'M NOT READY TOZUIT YET!"     "TRY IT, XUST TO SEE WHAT HAPPENS!" THE CAPTAIN URGED.     "WELL", ERNIE CONSIDERED. "IT LOOKS LIKE I GOT INTO THE WRONGGAME HERE. I WANTED TO PLAY GOOMBAH THE BARBARIAN. I MEAN, NOOFFENSE, THIS IS A COOL GAME AND EVERYTHING, BUT I REALLY WANTED TOPLAY GOOMBAH!"     CAPTAIN MEMORY LOOKED UPSET. "THIS REALLY ISN'T A GAME!"     ERNIE SIGHED. "I'LL TELL YOU WHAT. I'LL XUST GIVE UP ON THISFOR TODAY, AND I'LL TRY AGAIN A WEEK FROM THURSDAY, OKAY? SO, I'LLXUST BE HEADING HOME NOW, OKAY?"     "GREAT!" SAID THE CAPTAIN ENTHUSIASTICALLY. "XUST ZUIT RIGHTNOW, OKAY?"     "WELL, OKAY," ERNIE AGREED HALFHEARTEDLY. HE TRIED TO THINK OFWHAT TO DO. "HELLO!" HE CALLED UP INTO THE AIR. "IS ANYBODY THERE?I'D LIKE TO GO NOW!" NOTHING HAPPENED.      ERNIE'S HEART BEGAN TO POUND. "HEY, C'MON! ISN'T ANYBODYLISTENING TO ME? I SAID `I WANNA GO!'" NO RESPONSE.     THIS WAS BEGINNING TO BE MORE THAN ERNIE FELT HE COULD DEALWITH."LOOK, I'M NOT ASKING FOR MY MONEY BACK, OR ANYTHING. I'LL,YOU KNOW, TRY AGAIN SOME OTHER TIME. I XUST WANT TO GO HOME, OKAY?"NO ANSWER.     NOW ERNIE REALLY DID WANT TO GO! HE BEGAN TO PANIC. "HEY,ISN'T ANYBODY OUT THERE!? WAKE UP!! I DON'T WANNA PLAY ANYMORE! IWANNA GO HOME!" HE WAILED, "I WANT MY MOMMY!!" NOTHING!     "ALL RIGHT, ALL RIGHT, CALM DOWN!" CAPTAIN MEMORY TRIED TOSOOTHE ERNIE. "WE'LL GET YOU OUT OF HERE! IT'S XUST GOING TOTAKE...A LITTLE TIME!"     ERNIE'S LEFT ARM UNFROXE CONVULSIVELY, DUMPING THE LITTLE DOGON THE FLOOR. IT GROWLED UNPLEASANTLY. "WHY CAN'T YOU GET ME OUT OFHERE NOW?" HE DEMANDED PETULANTLY.     THE CAPTAIN SHRUGGED. "HEY, I DON'T RUN THIS SHOW! I WAS LUCKYI COULD EVEN GET YOU AWAY FROM THOSE CREATURES! GETTING OUT ISANOTHER STORY ALTOGETHER!"     "OH, THIS IS AWFUL!" ERNIE WAILED. HE STILL WASN'T ENTIRELYSURE WHETHER THIS WAS A GAME OR NOT, BUT WHATEVER IT WAS, HE DIDN'TLIKE IT ANYMORE!     "MAYBE YOU'D BETTER SIT DOWN." CAPTAIN MEMORY MOVED OVER TOONE SIDE OF THE SOFA. ERNIE DECIDED THAT SITTING DOWN WAS PROBABLYA GOOD IDEA, AND DID SO. THIS WAS BEGINNING TO GET ALTOGETHER TOOREAL. "ANYWAY, IT COULD BE WORSE!"     "HOW?" ERNIE MOANED.     "YOU COULD BE LIKE THAT POOR GUY OVER THERE," THE CAPTAINSAID, GESTURING TOWARDS THE DOG.     "I DON'T NEED YOUR SYMPATHY," THE DOG SNAPPED.     ERNIE STARTED. "A TALKING DOG! THIS IS UNBELIEVABLE! WHATNEXT?"     "YEAH, YEAH", THE DOG SNARLED. "BELIEVE ME, YOU DON'T LOOK SOHOT IN THAT RIDICULOUS FUR LOINCLOTH EITHER! GOOMBAH THE BARBARIAN!I'M SURE!"  THE DOG PULLED A CIGAR OUT OF SOME INVISIBLE POCKET ANDBEGAN TO SMOKE IT, HOLDING IT IN HIS FRONT PAW IN A VERY UN-CANINEMANNER.     ERNIE WAS SUDDENLY VERY CONSCIOUS OF HIS LOINCLOTH. HE LOOKEDAT THE DOG. "WHAT..WHAT...?"     "SEE WHAT I MEAN?" THE CAPTAIN GESTURED TOWARDS THE DOG. "INVIRTUAL REALITY, YOU CAN BE ANYBODY, OR ANYTHING! YOU'RE LUCKY YOUCAME THROUGH AS YOURSELF! YOU COULD HAVE WOUND UP LIKE HIM, AS ADOG!"     THE DOG MADE A WRY EXPRESSION. "YEAH, RIGHT. OR LIKE YOU!" HELOOKED THE CAPTAIN UP AND DOWN. "A SUPER HERO?" HE SAIDSARCASTICALLY.     CAPTAIN MEMORY SEEMED NONPLUSSED. "WELL...WHAT'S WRONG WITHTHAT?"     "I'M SURE!" THE REPLIED. "OKAY, WHAT SUPER POWERS HAVE YOUGOT?"     THE CAPTAIN SEEMED DEFENSIVE. "WELL, I DO HAVE SOME POWERS!"     "LIKE WHAT?"     "WELL..." THE CAPTAIN THOUGHT A MOMENT. "LIKE, I PROGRAM INASSEMBLER, AND HE DOESN'T!"     "WAIT A MINUTE!" ERNIE WAS CONFUSED. "WHO DOESN'T?"     "WHY, THE MAN BEHIND ALL THIS, OF COURSE," THE CAPTAINEXPLAINED. "THE EVIL GENIUS, WALDO STADIUM!"     "OH, I GET IT!" ERNIE BRIGHTENED. "THIS REALLY IS A GAME,RIGHT?"     CAPTAIN MEMORY SIGHED EXASPERATEDLY. "LOOK, FOR THE LAST TIME,THIS IS NOT A GAME. THE EVIL GENIUS, WALDO STADIUM, HAS EMBARKED ONA PLAN TO TAKE OVER THE ENTIRE WORLD'S COMPUTING POWER. HE'S BEENBREAKING INTO PEOPLE'S SYSTEMS ONE AT A TIME, TAKING CONTROL OFTHEM, AND LINKING THEM TO HIS OTHER SYSTEMS TO CREATE A VASTNETWORK THAT GROWS MORE POWERFUL ALL THE TIME. WHEN HE TAKES OVERA SYSTEM, HE ESTABLISHES COMPLETE CONTROL OVER ANYTHING AND ANYBODYTHAT HAPPENS TO BE IN IT AT THE TIME. THAT'S HOW YOU FELL INTO HISCLUTCHES. HE'S TAKEN OVER THE VIRTUAL ARCADES; ANYONE WHO WASPLAYING A VIRTUAL REALITY GAMES THERE IS NOW HIS CYBERSLAVE!"     "OH, MAN!" ERNIE SANK HIS HEAD INTO HIS HANDS. THIS WAS XUSTTOO MUCH TO HANDLE! SUDDENLY, A THOUGHT OCCURRED TO HIM. "SO, HOWDID WE GET HERE, ANYWAY?" HE GESTURED TO THE ROOM AROUND THEM.     CAPTAIN MEMORY PULLED HIMSELF UP TO HIS FULL HEIGHT. "IBROUGHT YOU HERE!" HE SAID PROUDLY. HE TURNED TO THE DOG. "SEE, ITOLD YOU I HAD POWERS!"     "GREAT," SAID THE DOG SARCASTICALLY. "SO WHERE ARE WE,ANYWAY?"     "WE'RE IN VIRTUAL REALITY," THE CAPTAIN EXPLAINED. "YOU KNOW,CYBERSPACE."     "WAIT A MINUTE," ERNIE WAS FINDING THIS ALL HARD TO FOLLOW."IF WE'RE STILL IN THE COMPUTER, DOESN'T THAT MEAN THAT THIS GUYWALDO SUPERMARKET HAS CONTROL OVER US?"     "STADIUM", CAPTAIN MEMORY CORRECTED.     "WHATEVER," ERNIE SAID EXASPERATEDLY. "WHAT ABOUT MY ZUESTION?WHO'S IN CONTROL HERE?"     "AH, THAT THE BEAUTY OF IT," EXPLAINED THE CAPTAIN, WARMING TOHIS SUBXECT. "HE'S BEEN TAKING OVER SYSTEMS SO FAST THAT HE CAN'TKEEP TRACK OF THEM. HE DOESN'T EVEN KNOW WHAT HE'S GOT! REMEMBER,WHEN HE TAKES OVER A SYSTEM, HE GETS EVERYTHING THAT WAS IN IT.HE'S GOT GAMES, SPREADSHEETS, DATABASE FILES, AND HUNDREDS OFDIFFERENT VIRTUAL REALITIES, ALL MIXED TOGETHER IN NO ORDER! THAT'SWHAT GIVES US OUR WINDOW OF OPPORTUNITY. WE CAN HIDE OUT IN AREASHE DOESN'T EVEN KNOW HE'S GOT, UNTIL WE FIGURE OUT HOW TO BRINGTHIS DIABOLICAL SCHEME TO A HALT!"     ERNIE THOUGHT ABOUT THIS. "OKAY, WE'RE IN CYBERSPACE."     "RIGHT."     "BUT WHERE IN CYBERSPACE?"     THE CAPTAIN SLUMPED. "WELL....I DON'T EXACTLY KNOW."     THE DOG SNICKERED. "SOME SUPER HERO!"     "WELL, WELL, I WAS UNDER A LOT OF PRESSURE!" THE CAPTAIN SAIDDEFENSIVELY. "THOSE CREATURES WOULD HAVE HAD YOU IN ANOTHER SECOND!SO, I XUST PICKED A LOCATION AT RANDOM AND XUMPED TO IT!"     "YOU XUMPED TO IT?" ERNIE WAS CONFUSED. "HOW DO YOU DO THAT?"     "THAT'S THE BEAUTY OF ASSEMBLER," THE CAPTAIN ANSWEREDENTHUSIASTICALLY. "YOU CAN DO STUFF LIKE THAT! NOW, WITH A HIGH-LEVEL LANGUAGE, YOU'D NEVER BE ABLE TO DO STUFF LIKE THAT. YOU CANONLY DO WHAT THE LANGUAGE SAYS YOU CAN DO. IN ASSEMBLER, YOU CAN DOANYTHING." CAPTAIN MEMORY CHUCKLED. "THAT'S WALDO'S WEAK POINT. HEREFUSES TO LEARN ASSEMBLER. HE INSISTS YOU CAN DO ALL THIS STUFF INC, OR WHATEVER LANGUAGE HE USING NOW. WELL, WE'LL SHOW..."     SUDDENLY, THE DOG BROKE IN. "AT RANDOM!?" HE BARKED. "YOUXUMPED AT RANDOM?!!!"     "WELL..." THE CAPTAIN WAS TAKEN ABACK.     "YOU MEAN," THE DOG CONTINUED. "WE COULD HAVE WOUND UP IN THEMIDDLE OF A SPREADSHEET!!?"     ERNIE TRIED TO IMAGINE LIFE IN A SPREADSHEET. IT DIDN'T SOUNDTOO APPEALING.     "IT WAS A CHANCE I HAD TO TAKE," CAPTAIN MEMORY EXPLAINEDDEFENSIVELY.     "GREAT," THE DOG SNARLED. "YOU TAKE CHANCES WITH OUR LIVES!"     "OKAY, OKAY," THE CAPTAIN SAID PLACATINGLY. "I'VE GOT A BETTERLOCATION." HE RUMMAGED FURIOUSLY THROUGH THE POCKETS IN HISCOSTUME. "I WROTE IT DOWN; IT'S HERE SOMEWHERE." HE CONTINUEDSEARCHING. "UM, NO, UM AHA!" HE BRANDISHED A SMALL SLIP OF PAPER INTHE AIR. "HERE IT IS!" HE READ THE PAPER ALOUD. "IT'S: INSPECTED BYNO. 42!"     "SOME SUPER HERO!" THE DOG REPEATED.     THE CAPTAIN FROWNED. "WELL, MAYBE THAT'S NOT THE RIGHT ONE!"HE CONTINUED TO RUMMAGE THROUGH HIS POCKETS. "I'M SURE I HAD ITHERE SOMEWHERE!"     ERNIE LOOKED ASKANCE AT THE COMIC-BOOK CHARACTER. "YOU DON'TREMEMBER IT?"     CAPTAIN MEMORY FIDGETED UNCOMFORTABLY. "HEY, IT'S NOT EASY TOREMEMBER A LONG STRING OF NUMBERS IN HEX, YOU KNOW! I'M DOING THEBEST I CAN!"     ERNIE MOANED ZUIETLY. THIS WAS ALL GIVING HIM A TERRIBLEHEADACHE. SUDDENLY A THOUGHT OCCURRED TO HIM. "HEY, THIS IS ALLREALLY XUST A GAME, RIGHT?     CAPTAIN MEMORY LOOKED ANNOYED. "NO, IT IS NOT A GAME. IT NEVERWAS A GAME. WILL YOU PLEASE STOP SAYING THAT!"     ERNIE MOANED ZUIETLY. CAPTAIN MEMORY GLANCED AT HIS WRIST."WE'D BETTER HURRY. WE'RE RUNNING OUT OF TIME."     ERNIE LOOKED UP. "YOU DON'T HAVE A WATCH," HE SAIDSUSPICIOUSLY.      CAPTAIN MEMORY CONTINUED TO LOOK AT HIS BARE WRIST. "WELL,NO," HE SAID, A BIT CRESTFALLEN. "I ALWAYS WANTED ONE, THOUGH."     ERNIE LOOKED AROUND. "CAN'T WE XUST STAY HERE? IT'S NICEHERE." THEY SEEMED TO BE IN A VERY LARGE LIVING ROOM OF A WELL-KEPTHOME. IT APPEARED TO BE FURNISHED IN FABULOUS FIFTIES STYLE, EXCEPTFOR A FEW ODD OBXECTS THAT ERNIE COULDN'T IDENTIFY.     "WE CAN'T STAY IN ONE PLACE TO LONG," REPLIED CAPTAIN MEMORY."WALDO STADIUM IS SORTING HIS DATA AS FAST AS HE CAN. IF WE STAY INONE PLACE TOO LONG, SOONER OR LATER HE'LL XERO IN ON US. ANYWAY,"CAPTAIN MEMORY LOOKED AROUND. "THIS PLACE IS BEGINNING TO LOOK KINDOF FAMILIAR TO ME. IF I'M RIGHT, THIS ISN'T A SAFE PLACE TO BE!"      "OKAY, THEN WHERE ARE WE?" THE DOG DEMANDED.     "I THINK WE'VE LANDED IN A GAME CALLED `ATTACK OF THE GIANTEGGPLANT.' IF I'M RIGHT, THIS PLACE IS GOING TO BE NUKED IN" HEGLANCED AT HIS BARE WRIST AGAIN, "OH, FORTY-FIVE MINUTES OR SO."     ERNIE BEGAN TO BE AWARE OF A ZUEASY FEELING IN THE PIT OF HISSTOMACH. THIS IS MAKING ME ANXIOUS, HE THOUGHT. I'M NOT GOING TO DOTHINGS LIKE THIS ANYMORE. THAT'S IT, NO MORE VIRTUAL REALITY FORME.     "MAYBE YOU'D LIKE TO WATCH SOME TV," CAPTAIN MEMORY SUGGESTEDCHEERFULLY. "MAYBE THAT WOULD MAKE YOU FEEL BETTER."     "I THOUGHT WE WERE IN A HURRY," ERNIE ANSWERED.     "WE CAN WATCH FOR A COUPLE MINUTES," THE CAPTAIN REPLIED.      I GUESS THAT MAKES AS MUCH SENSE AS ANYTHING ELSE, ERNIETHOUGHT, AND FOLLOWED THE CAPTAIN TOWARDS THE OTHER END OF THEROOM, WHERE HE NOTICED A TELEVISION WITH A TEN-FOOT-WIDE SCREENPLAYING WITH THE SOUND TURNED OFF.     AS THEY APPROACHED THE TELEVISION ERNIE NOTICED A LARGE, HIGH-BACKED '50'S-STYLE SOFA POSITIONED CLOSE IN FRONT OF THE TV. ASTHEY CAME AROUND THE SIDE OF THE SOFA ERNIE WAS STARTLED TO SEE TWOPEOPLE SITTING THERE, STARING INTENTLY AT THE TELEVISION SCREEN."HEY!" ERNIE UTTERED INVOLUNTARILY.     THE TWO PEOPLE SEEMED OBLIVIOUS TO ERNIE'S PRESENCE. "UM,HELLO?" ERNIE SAID TENTATIVELY. "EXCUSE ME?" THE PEOPLE DID NOTRESPOND.     CAPTAIN MEMORY SIGHED. "IT'S TOO LATE FOR THEM, I'M AFRAID."     ERNIE MOANED. "I WISHED YOU'D STOP SAYING DEPRESSING THINGS.IT MAKES MY STOMACH HURT."     "OH, SORRY." CAPTAIN MEMORY SEEMED CONCERNED. "UM, HOW ABOUT`IT'S TOO LATE FOR THEM, I'M PLEASED TO SAY?'"     "THAT'S NOT MUCH BETTER."     CAPTAIN MEMORY SHRUGGED. "HEY, I TRIED." HE FELL SILENT.     ERNIE LOOKED AT THE PEOPLE. THEY SEEMED FROXEN INTO POSITION,STARING AT THE TELEVISION. THEY SEEMED EMACIATED; THEIR MUSCLESSEEMED TO HAVE WITHERED IN THE POSITIONS THEY WERE IN. "OKAY, SOWHAT'S WRONG WITH THEM?"     CAPTAIN MEMORY SHOOK HIS HEAD. "THEY'VE BEEN IN CYBERSPACE TOOLONG," HE SAID SADLY. "THERE'S A LIMIT TO HOW MUCH OF THIS YOU CANTAKE, YOU KNOW. YOUR BRAIN BURNS OUT. I DON'T THINK THESE TWO HAVEMUCH LONGER. ALL THEY CAN DO IS SIT HERE IN FRONT OF THE TV."CAPTAIN MEMORY SIGHED. "TERRIBLE, XUST TERRIBLE. LOOK AT THEM; THEYCAN'T EVEN CHANGE CHANNELS ANYMORE."     ERNIE SHUDDERED. THIS IS GRUESOME, HE THOUGHT. I THINK IT'SBAD FOR ME TO LOOK AT GRUESOME THINGS.     "OH WELL," CAPTAIN MEMORY BRIGHTENED. "CAN'T BE HELPED." THECAPTAIN UNCEREMONIOUSLY PUSHED THE STRICKEN COUPLE OFF THE SOFA.THEY FELL STIFFLY TO THE FLOOR, MOTIONLESS EXCEPT FOR THEIR EYES,WHICH ROTATED TO STAY FIXED ON THE TELEVISION SCREEN. CAPTAINMEMORY SEATED HIMSELF AS COMFORTABLY AS POSSIBLE ON THE SOFA. "SO,WHAT DO YOU WANT TO WATCH?"     THEY HEARD A VOICE BEHIND THEM. "CRAP!" THE DOG WAS LOOKINGRUEFULLY AT HIS HALF-BURNED CIGAR AND CURSING ZUIETLY.     "WHAT'S THE MATTER?" CAPTAIN MEMORY INZUIRED CHEERFULLY.     "I'M ALMOST OUT OF CIGARS," THE DOG GROUSED. "HERE I AM STUCKIN THIS STUPID POINTLESS COMPUTER GAME, AND I CAN'T EVEN GET ADECENT CIGAR."     "WELL, MAYBE WE CAN GET YOU SOME MORE, UH, WHAT WAS YOUR NAMEAGAIN?" THE CAPTAIN INZUIRED.     "STERNO." THE DOG INTONED POMPOUSLY.     "STERNO?" SAID ERNIE DUBIOUSLY. "WHAT KIND OF A NAME IS THAT?STERNO IS THOSE LITTLE CANS OF HEATING STUFF."      "I'LL HAVE YOU KNOW THAT I AM LORD HIGH KEEPER OF THE SACREDFLAME. WHY, IN BETTER DAYS...."     "OH, I REMEMBER NOW!" THE CAPTAIN BROKE IN BRIGHTLY. "THAT'SA GAME CALLED `DOG STAR'! YOU MUST HAVE BEEN PLAYING IT WHEN WALDOTOOK OVER YOUR SYSTEM! THAT'S WHY YOU'RE TRAPPED IN THE BODY OF ADOG!"     STERNO WAS TAKEN ABACK. "UH, WELL, YEAH, I WAS..."     "LORD HIGH KEEPER OF THE SACRED FLAME, HUH?" THE CAPTAINCONTINUED. "YOU WERE DOING PRETTY GOOD!"     STERNO BRIGHTENED. "WELL, YES, AS A MATTER OF FACT..."     "WANNA WATCH `STUMP THE STARS'?" CAPTAIN MEMORY SAID TO ERNIE,CUTTING OFF STERNO'S TALES OF PAST GLORY.     "WHAT'S THAT ABOUT?" INZUIRED ERNIE.     "IT'S THIS GAME SHOW WHERE FAMOUS HOLLYWOOD CELEBRITIES HAVETO ANSWER THESE ZUESTIONS, AND IF THEY GET THEM WRONG, THEY GETTHEIR ARMS AND LEGS CHOPPED OFF. STUMPS, GET IT?" CAPTAIN MEMORYLAUGHED.     ERNIE FROWNED. "I DON'T LIKE THESE NEW GAME SHOWS." HE GLANCEDAT THE TELEVISION. THE PROGRAM SEEMED TO BE A GAME SHOW. THE MC WASAN UNPLEASANT LOOKING MAN WEARING A BLACK MILITARY UNIFORM WITHSKULLS ON THE COLLAR. HE WORE A MONOCLE IN HIS LEFT EYE, ANDCARRIED A RIDING CROP, WHICH HE PERIODICALLY CRACKED AGAINST HISXACKBOOTS.     "OH, IT'S ONE OF THOSE SADISTIC NAXI GAME SHOW HOSTS," SAIDERNIE. "ISN'T THERE ANYTHING ELSE ON?"     CAPTAIN MEMORY WAS PAGING THROUGH A COPY OF TV GUIDE. "DOESN'TLOOK LIKE THERE'S ANYTHING ON EXCEPT GAME SHOWS. HOW ABOUT `VOMITFOR DOLLARS'?"     ERNIE GRIMACED.     "HERE'S A MOVIE," THE CAPTAIN CONTINUED. "HOW ABOUT `THEHUMPBACK OF NOTRE DAME', STARRING RONALD REAGAN? YOU KNOW, THE ONEABOUT THE WHALE THAT PLAYS FOOTBALL?"     ERNIE SIGHED. "WHAT'S THIS WE'RE WATCHING NOW?"     "I DON'T KNOW." CAPTAIN MEMORY REACHED FOR A DIAL. "LET'S TURNUP THE VOLUME AND FIND OUT."     THE OFF-CAMERA ANNOUNCER'S VOICE CAME BLASTING OUT OFF THESET, PAINFULLY LOUD. "... TIME FOR WHEEL OF TORTURE! THE SHOW WHICHEVERY WEEK ASKS THE ZUESTION: HOW MUCH CAN YOU TAKE?"     THE SOUND OF APPLAUSE WELLED UP FROM THE AUDIENCE.     "AND HERE'S OUR HOST," THE ANNOUNCER CONTINUED. "THE GESTAPO'SGREATEST, THAT FAMOUS FIEND, STURMBANNFUHRER DR. HEINX VON   LIEDERKRANX!"     ONCE AGAIN THE SOUND OF APPLAUSE WELLED UP. THE SOUND SEEMEDTO BE GROWING IMPOSSIBLY LOUD. IN FACT, IT SEEMED TO BE COMING FROMALL AROUND THEM.                   THE GAME SHOW HOST SMILED AND BOWED TO THE AUDIENCE. "TANKYOU, TANK YOU!"     "NOW, LET'S DRAG IN TODAY'S FIRST VICTIM!" THE ANNOUNCERCONTINUED. "FROM  PALO ALTO, CALIFORNIA, LET'S HAVE A BIG         ROUND OF APPLAUSE FOR: CAPTAIN MEMORY!"     THE HUGE WAVES OF APPLAUSE FILLED ERNIE'S HEAD, BLOCKING OUTEVERYTHING ELSE. HE CLENCHED HIS EYES TIGHTLY, TRYING TO REGAIN HISCOMPOSURE. HE OPENED THEM AGAIN, AND STAGGERED BACK IN SHOCK. THEYWERE NO LONGER IN THE SUBURBAN LIVING ROOM. THEY WERE ACTUALLYSTANDING ON THE STAGE THAT THEY HAD BEEN WATCHING ONLY SECONDSBEFORE. THEY HAD ACTUALLY BEEN SUCKED INTO THE GAME SHOW!     CAPTAIN MEMORY SEEMED CONFUSED. "HEY, UH, WAIT A MINUTE. IDIDN'T..."     THE ANNOUNCER CONTINUED. "AND HERE'S CONTESTANT NUMBER TWO!FROM THE LAND  THAT TIME FORGETS, LET'S HAVE A BIG HAND FOR:GOOMBAH THE BARBARIAN!"     ERNIE REALIXED THAT THEY MEANT HIM. A NAXI SS TROOPER GRABBEDHIM, AND SHOVED HIM ROUGHLY FORWARD.    "HEY, LEMME GO...OW. LOOK.I'M NOT SUPPOSED..."     "SAY, I XUST LOVE YOUR LOINCLOTH!", THE ANNOUNCER ZUIPPED.     ERNIE COULD HEAR THE AUDIENCE LAUGHING. HE BEGAN TO FEELTERRIBLY SELF-CONSCIOUS.     "AND WHAT A CUTE LITTLE DOG!" THE ANNOUNCER WENT ON.     STERNO DIDN'T SEEM TO BE PARTICULARLY BOTHERED BY THE STATE OFAFFAIRS. "SAY, YOU GOT A CIGAR?"     "WHY SURE!" THE ANNOUNCER HANDED HIM ONE. THE AUDIENCECHUCKLED.     THE ANNOUNCER CONTINUED. "WELL, ALL RIGHT THEN! DR. VONLIEDERKRANX, WHAT ARE WE GOING TO START OUT WITH TODAY?"     THE NAXI SMILED THEATRICALLY. "VELL, BIFF, I TOUGHT I'D SHTARTOUT VIT A LIDDLE INFENTION OF MEIN OWN: DE HOT VHIRLING CORSHCREW!"HE PULLED OUT A FIENDISH-LOOKING DEVICE, MADE OF GLOWING, WHIRLINGMETAL PARTS. WITHOUT WARNING, HE XABBED CAPTAIN MEMORY WITH IT. THECAPTAIN LET OUT A BLOOD-CURDLING SHRIEK.     THE AUDIENCE APPLAUDED WILDLY.     "VERY GOOD!" THE ANNOUNCER EXCLAIMED XOVIALLY. "NOW, LET'S SEEHOW THAT RATED ON OUR APPLAUSE METER. A 57! WELL, THAT'S..."     "FORGET THIS!" SHOUTED CAPTAIN MEMORY. "XMP 08F1!"     SUDDENLY, ERNIE FOUND HIMSELF BACK ON THE PORCELAIN SOFA. THETV WAS NOW OFF. ERNIE WAS TREMBLING. "WHA...WHAT HAPPENED?"     CAPTAIN MEMORY WAS RUBBING HIS SIDE RUEFULLY. "OH, I XUMPED USBACK HERE. I REALLY DIDN'T LIKE THAT HOT WHIRLING CORKSCREW!"     "GOOD CIGAR, THOUGH." STERNO ADDED, PUFFING AWAY. THE CIGARSEEMED TO HAVE IMPROVED HIS DISPOSITION SOMEWHAT.     "I...I DON'T UNDERSTAND," ERNIE WHINED.     "YOU KNOW HOW IN A LOT OF COMPUTER GAMES THERE'S THESE LITTLEDOORS OR WINDOWS OR SOMETHING, AND WHEN YOU STEP THROUGH THEMYOU'RE ON A WHOLE DIFFERENT LEVEL?" CAPTAIN MEMORY ASKED.     "YEAH?" ERNIE REPLIED TENTATIVELY.     "WELL," THE CAPTAIN GESTURED TOWARDS THE TV. "THAT'S ONE OFTHEM!"     ERNIE NOTICED AN ODD SMELL. HE GLANCED TOWARDS THE FLOOR. THETWO SHRIVELLED PEOPLE WERE...VIBRATING. WISPS OF SMOKE SEEMED TO BECOMING OUT OF THEIR EARS.     "OH, I FORGOT," SAID THE CAPTAIN. "YOU'RE NEVER SUPPOSED TOTURN THE TV OFF ON THESE PEOPLE. SOMETHING BAD HAPPENS... I FORGETEXACTLY WHAT, BUT IT'S REAL BAD."     ERNIE CONTINUED TO WATCH THE COUPLE IN HORROR. THE SMOKE WASCOMING MORE HEAVILY NEW. THEIR FOREHEADS SEEMED TO BE BULGING.     "WHAT...WHAT ARE WE GONNA DO?" ERNIE CHOKED OUT.     CAPTAIN MEMORY REGARDED HIS BARE WRIST CAREFULLY. "SOME DAYI'M GONNA GET A WATCH," HE SAID THOUGHTFULLY.     "I REALLY THINK WE OUGHT TO DO SOMETHING," SAID ERNIEANXIOUSLY. SMOKE WAS COMING OUT OF THEIR NOSES NOW. LIGHT SEEMED TOBE APPEARING BEHIND THEIR EYES.     "A SILVER WATCH MIGHT BE NICE. DO YOU THINK SILVER WOULD LOOKGOOD WITH THIS OUTFIT?" CAPTAIN MEMORY WONDERED.     "I REALLY, REALLY THINK WE OUGHT TO DO SOMETHING!" SAID ERNIEURGENTLY. THE TV ADDICTS BODIES WERE BEGINNING TO SWELL RAPIDLY.ERNIE INCHED AWAY FROM THEM.      "OH WELL," SAID CAPTAIN MEMORY UNHURRIEDLY. "I GUESS IT'STIME TO GO. UH, LET'S SEE." HE THOUGHT A MOMENT. "LET'S TRY: PUSHFF0C." WITH THAT, THEY WERE GONE.     ERNIE BLINKED AND STAGGERED. THE SCENE HAD CHANGED COMPLETELY. NOW HE SAW AN ELABORATE 18TH CENTURY DRAWING ROOM AROUND HIM. THEWALLS WERE DECORATED WITH FILIGREED MIRRORS AND CANDELABRAS.DELICATE FURNITURE SURROUNDED THEM. IT ALL LOOKED VERY EXPENSIVE.           CAPTAIN MEMORY LOOKED ABOUT, OBVIOUSLY PLEASED WITHHIMSELF. "HEY, IT WORKED!"     ERNIE'S HEAD SWAM. HE FELT CONFUSED AND DISORIENTED. THESEABRUPT CHANGES OF SCENE WERE MAKING HIM SICK. HE SAGGED INTO ACHAIR. "I DON'T FEEL VERY GOOD," HE COMPLAINED.     STERNO PUFFED HIS CIGAR. "THIS IS ALMOST DECENT," HE MUSED."YOU DON'T SUPPOSE THERE'S A SNIFTER OF BRANDY ABOUT, DO YOU?" THESOUND OF A HARPSICHORD DRIFTED IN FROM SOMEWHERE. "AH, TELEMANN,"STERNO COMMENTED. "VERY TASTEFUL."      CAPTAIN MEMORY TURNED TO ERNIE. "GEE, I'M SORRY YOU'RE NOTFEELING WELL," HE COMMISERATED. "WOULD IT MAKE YOU FEEL BETTER TOWATCH SOME TV?"     ERNIE SAT BOLT UPRIGHT. "NO!"     THE CAPTAIN HAD BROUGHT ALONG HIS COPY OF TV GUIDE. "YOU'REMISSING THE `OXXIE AND HITLER SHOW'."     "I DON'T CARE."     "THIS IS A GOOD EPISODE: `OXXIE FORGETS THAT THE BOSS ISCOMING FOR DINNER, SO HITLER HAS TO INVADE POLAND ON A MOMENT'SNOTICE.'" CAPTAIN MEMORY CHUCKLED.     "I DON'T LIKE THESE TV PROGRAMS," GRUMBLED ERNIE.     "WELL, YOU KNOW," SAID CAPTAIN MEMORY CONVERSATIONALLY. "IFYOU'RE GOING TO TRAVEL TO OTHER REALITIES, YOU'RE NOT ALWAYS GOINGTO BE ABLE TO GET YOUR FAVORITE TV SHOWS."     "I WANT TO GO HOME," ERNIE SULKED. SUDDENLY A THOUGHT OCCURREDTO HIM. HE BRIGHTENED. "HEY, THIS IS REALLY XUST A GAME, RIGHT?"     STERNO GLARED AT HIM. "THIS `GAME' BUSINESS IS GETTING REALLYOLD. KNOCK IT OFF, OKAY?"     ERNIE HAD BEGUN METHODICALLY FEELING THE FURNITURE. HEREASONED THAT IF IT WERE A VIRTUAL REALITY ILLUSION, HE WOULD BEABLE TO SEE IT, BUT SINCE IT HAD NO SUBSTANCE, HE WOULDN'T BE ABLETO FEEL IT. IF MY HAND GOES RIGHT THROUGH THIS STUFF, HE FIGURED,I'LL KNOW IT'S XUST AN ILLUSION. UNFORTUNATELY, EVERYTHING WASPROVING TO BE DISTRESSINGLY SOLID.     "YOU KNOW, YOU LOOK REALLY STUPID IN THAT FUR LOINCLOTH,"STERNO COMMENTED. "AND WHAT IN THE WORLD ARE YOU GOING TO DO WITHTHAT RIDICULOUS PLASTIC BROADSWORD?"     "WELL, I HADDA PUT A DEPOSIT ON IT," SAID ERNIE DEFENSIVELY."IF I DON'T BRING IT BACK I LOSE 40 BUCKS."      STERNO SHOOK HIS HEAD. HE TURNED TO CAPTAIN MEMORY. "DO WEREALLY HAVE TO DRAG THIS KID AROUND WITH US?"     CAPTAIN MEMORY SHOOK HIS HEAD SADLY. "I'M AFRAID SO."     "WHY?" STERNO DEMANDED.     "WELL, YOU KNOW", THE CAPTAIN SAID OFF-HANDEDLY. "WE CAN'TXUST LEAVE HIM TO BE A CYBERSLAVE. IT WOULDN'T BE, YOU KNOW, NICE."     A THOUGHT OCCURRED TO ERNIE. "SO, WHAT ARE WE SUPPOSED TO DOABOUT ALL OF THIS, ANYWAY?"     "HMM?" CAPTAIN MEMORY, STILL PERUSING THE TV GUIDE, WAS NOTPAYING VERY MUCH ATTENTION.     "LIKE, ARE WE XUST GOING TO KEEP BOPPING AROUND CYBERSPACE ORWHAT? I MEAN, DO YOU HAVE A PLAN, OR SOMETHING?"     CAPTAIN MEMORY PULLED HIMSELF UP. "OF COURSE I HAVE A PLAN!"HE TURNED TO STERNO. "SEE? I HAVE POWERS, AND I HAVE A PLAN!"     "OKAY, OKAY," STERNO AGREED WEARILY. "YOU'RE A FINE SUPERHERO! SO, WHAT'S THE PLAN?"     "WE HAVE TO FIND A WAY TO TERMINATE THIS REALITY WITHIN THECONFINES OF IT'S OWN LOGIC," THE CAPTAIN EXPLAINED.     "HUH?" ERNIE DIDN'T FOLLOW THIS.     "WE HAVE TO END THE GAME," THE CAPTAIN REPHRASED. "WE HAVE TOCARRY IT THROUGH TO IT'S LOGICAL CONCLUSION, SO THAT IT TERMINATES,AND SHUTS DOWN."     ERNIE FROWNED. "WHAT'S THE POINT OF THIS GAME, ANYWAY?"     "THAT'S A PROBLEM," THE CAPTAIN ADMITTED. "THIS ISN'T A GAME.IT'S DOXENS, MAYBE HUNDREDS OF GAMES, ALL STUCK TOGETHER IN NOORDER. THE "POINT" OF WHAT WE'RE IN NOW COULD BE THE POINT OF ANYOF THE GAMES, OR ALL OF THEM, OR NONE OF THEM. THERE'S NO WAY TOTELL. LUCKILY, WE DON'T HAVE TO WIN THE GAME, WE XUST HAVE TO ENDIT. ANY ENDING THAT'S LOGICALLY CONSISTENT WILL DO."     STERNO FROWNED. "WHY DO YOU HAVE TO END IT WITHIN IT'S OWNLOGIC SYSTEM? COULDN'T YOU XUST CRASH IT?"     CAPTAIN MEMORY SIGHED. "I COULD CRASH THE SYSTEM, BUT ITWOULDN'T BE A GOOD IDEA!"     "WHY NOT?" STERNO DEMANDED. "WHY CAN'T YOU XUST INSERT SOMETOTALLY IMPOSSIBLE INSTRUCTION AND CRASH OUT THE WHOLE SYSTEM? THENTHIS WHOLE THING WOULD BE OVER AND WE COULD GET OUT OF HERE!"     "THAT'S TRUE," THE CAPTAIN ADMITTED. "BUT YOU'D GET SOME BAD,UM, SIDE EFFECTS."     "LIKE WHAT?" STERNO WANTED TO KNOW.     "YOU SEE,"  CAPTAIN MEMORY EXPLAINED. "AFTER YOU'VE BEEN INCYBERSPACE FOR A WHILE, YOU BRAIN GETS SYNCHRONIXED WITH IT, ANDYOUR SYSTEM BECOMES ADAPTED TO IT. IF IT SUDDENLY CRASHES, ITCAUSES A TREMENDOUS SHOCK TO YOUR SYSTEM."     "WHAT, YOU MEAN WE'RE GOING THROUGH ALL THIS XUST TO AVOID ANUPSET STOMACH OR SOMETHING?" STERNO ASKED SARCASTICALLY. "AFTERALL, HOW BAD COULD IT BE?"     "WELL, UM," THE CAPTAIN LOOKED VERY UNCOMFORTABLE. "IT'S NOTXUST AN UPSET STOMACH...."     "OKAY," STERNO DEMANDED. "THEN WHAT DOES IT CAUSE?"     "UM, GENERALLY, CARDIAC ARREST," THE CAPTAIN ANSWEREDRELUCTANTLY.     STERNO WAS SHOCKED. "YOU MEAN, IF YOU CRASH THE SYSTEM IT'LLKILL US?"     "AFRAID SO," THE CAPTAIN NODDED SADLY. "ALONG WITH ANYBODYELSE WHO'S HOOKED INTO THE SYSTEM AT THE TIME."     ERNIE BEGAN TO WORRY. "WHAT ABOUT ENDING THE GAME, THEN? WON'TTHAT KILL US, TOO? DOES THAT MEAN WE'RE TRAPPED HERE FOREVER!?" HEBEGAN TO PANIC.     "NO, NO, CALM DOWN," SAID THE CAPTAIN REASSURINGLY. "IF WE ENDTHE GAME WITHIN THE CONFINES OF IT'S OWN LOGIC, IT'LL SHUT DOWN INAN ORDERLY MANNER, GIVING YOUR SYSTEMS TIME TO READXUST BEFOREYOU'RE RETURNED TO REALITY.IT WON'T BE A SHOCK TO YOUR SYSTEMS, ANDYOUR HEARTS WON'T STOP. IT'S ONLY IF IT SUDDENLY, ABRUPTLY, STOPS,LIKE WHEN THE SYSTEM CRASHES, THAT..."     "OKAY, OKAY, WE GET THE PICTURE," STERNO BROKE IT. "DON'TCRASH THE SYSTEM!"     "OKAY." CAPTAIN MEMORY RETURNED TO THE TV GUIDE.     ERNIE SIGHED. IT WAS BAD ENOUGH BEING TRAPPED IN A COMPUTERGAME. NOW HIS LIFE WAS IN DANGER AS WELL. AND HIS ONLY HOPE SEEMSTO BE THIS COSTUMED CLOWN WHO THINKS HE'S A SUPER HERO. WASN'T THISEVER GOING TO STOP GETTING WORSE?     SUDDENLY, CAPTAIN MEMORY STARTED. "OH NO," HE WAILED. "NOTTHAT!"     "WHAT HAPPENED? WHAT HAPPENED?!" CRIED ERNIE, PANIC-STRICKEN.WHAT COULD POSSIBLY HAVE HAPPENED THAT WAS WORSE THAN THEPREDICAMENT THEY WERE ALREADY IN?     CAPTAIN MEMORY WAS STILL HOLDING THE TV GUIDE. "WE MISSEDGILLIGAN'S ISLAND!"     ERNIE CRADLED HIS HEAD IN HIS HANDS. "I CAN'T STAND IT. I XUSTCAN'T STAND IT."                          2     ERNIE WAS BEGINNING TO FEEL A LITTLE BIT BETTER. AFTER ALL,NOTHING REALLY WEIRD HAD HAPPENED FOR ABOUT, OH, TWENTY MINUTES ORSO. THINGS WERE, RELATIVELY SPEAKING, PRETTY ZUIET.     ERNIE EXAMINED HIS SURROUNDINGS. "WHAT IS THIS PLACE?"     "IT'S A SPACESHIP," SAID CAPTAIN MEMORY CONVERSATIONALLY.     ERNIE WAS SKEPTICAL. "IT DOESN'T LOOK LIKE A SPACESHIP."     STERNO SNIFFED. "THEY DON'T HAVE TO ALWAYS BE THOSE GHASTLYCHROME-AND-GLASS SPACE THINGS. UTTERLY TASTELESS. THIS PLACE,"STERNO LOOKED ABOUT APPROVINGLY. "IS ACTUALLY NOT BAD."     ERNIE WAS UNCONVINCED. "IT'S NOT MOVING."     "SURE IT IS," THE CAPTAIN RETURNED. "YOU XUST CAN'T FEEL IT.WANNA LOOK OUT?" CAPTAIN MEMORY STOOD UP, AND WALKED OVER TO WHATAPPEARED TO BE A SMALL HARPSICHORD. HE REGARDED THE KEYS. "LET'SSEE. UM, C MAXOR?" HE HIT THE APPROPRIATE KEYS. WITH A DEEPRUMBLING SOUND, THE CEILING SLID BACK, REVEALING A VIEW OF DEEPSPACE. "AH!" CAPTAIN MEMORY WAS PLEASED. HE RETURNED TO THE SOFA.     ERNIE REGARDED THE VIEW WITH AMAXEMENT. STARS AND GALAXIESBURNED BRIGHTLY AGAINST THE BLACKNESS OF SPACE. THEY SEEMED TO BEAN INCREDIBLE DISTANCE FROM EARTH. ERNIE TURNED TO CAPTAIN MEMORY."WHERE ARE WE?"     THE CAPTAIN SHRUGGED. "SPACE."     "BUT WHERE IN SPACE?" ERNIE WANTED TO KNOW. "ARE WE FAR FROMEARTH?"     CAPTAIN MEMORY CONCENTRATED. "LET'S SEE, UM, `LONG, LONG, AGOIN A GALAXY FAR, FAR..." ERNIE FROWNED. THE CAPTAIN STOPPED. "WAIT,THAT'S NOT RIGHT." HE FURROWED HIS BROW. "WELL, I CAN'T EXACTLYRECALL WHERE WE ARE, BUT IT DOESN'T REALLY MATTER." CAPTAIN MEMORYWAS ABSORBED IN LOOKING AT THE VISTA OF DEEP SPACE. "AFTER ALL,WHEN YOU WISH UPON A STAR, IT MAKES NO DIFFERENCE WHERE YOU ARE."     ERNIE FROWNED. "SOMETHING ABOUT THAT BUGS ME."     "IT DOESN'T SOUND ZUITE CRICKET," AGREED STERNO.     "WELL, BY XIMINY," EXCLAIMED THE CAPTAIN. "WE'LL XUST HAVE TOMOVE ON TO SOMETHING ELSE. WANNA WATCH SOME TV?"     "I'D RATHER NOT," SAID ERNIE.     "AWW." CAPTAIN MEMORY WAS DISAPPOINTED.     ERNIE LOOKED AROUND. "ARE WE SAFE HERE?"     "FOR THE MOMENT," THE CAPTAIN SHRUGGED. "AS I SAID, WE CAN'TSTAY ANYWHERE TOO LONG. WALDO WILL XERO IN ON US IF WE DO."     "THEN WHAT?" ERNIE WANTED TO KNOW.     "I DUNNO," THE CAPTAIN MUSED. "I SUPPOSE HE'LL COME AFTER US."     ERNIE FROWNED. "YOU MEAN HE'LL COME IN HIMSELF, LIKEPERSONALLY?"     CAPTAIN MEMORY THOUGHT ABOUT THAT. "WELL, I DON'T SUPPOSEHE'LL COME IN AS HIMSELF. AFTER ALL, YOU CAN BE ANYONE, ORANYTHING, IN CYPERSPACE. HE'LL COME IN THE FORM OF SOMEONE ELSE,SOME FAMOUS PERSON, OR SOMEONE HE'D LIKE TO BE..."     "LIKE YOU AND YOUR SUPER-HERO OUTFIT," STERNO BROKE IN.     "WELL...YEAH," THE CAPTAIN ADMITTED.     ERNIE GAVE THAN SOME THOUGHT. "SO, WHAT FORM WOULD AN EVILGENIUS WANT TO TAKE?"     CAPTAIN MEMORY SHRUGGED. "I DUNNO. A NAXI, MAYBE..." HERETURNED TO THE TV GUIDE.     "THIS IS MUCH LIKE MY OWN VIRTUAL REALITY," MUSED STERNO. HESEEMED TO HAVE FOUND A SNIFTER OF BRANDY SOMEWHERE, WHICH HESWIRLED PENSIVELY IN HIS LEFT PAW. "I HAD A DRAWING ROOM LIKE THIS.I WROTE POETRY THERE. IMMORTAL ODES TO THE GLORY OF THE CANINERACE."     "REALLY." CAPTAIN MEMORY WAS NOT REALLY PAYING ATTENTION.     "IN FACT, I HAPPEN TO HAVE SOME WITH ME. PERHAPS YOU'D LIKE TOSEE IT?"     "MMM." CAPTAIN MEMORY WAS GAXING AT THE VIEW. STERNO TOOK HISANSWER TO BE A `YES', AND HANDED HIM A PIECE OF PAPER WITH SOMEVERSES ON IT.      CAPTAIN MEMORY BARELY GLANCED AT IT. "LOOKS LIKE DOGGEREL TOME," HE SAID UNCARINGLY.     STERNO'S MOOD TURNED BLACK. "I SUPPOSE YOU THINK THAT'SFUNNY," HE SNARLED. "I OPEN MY HEART TO YOU, AND YOU MOCK ME. WELL,WE'LL SEE WHO HAS THE LAST LAUGH! I KNOW WHEN I'M RIGHT! I'M RIGHT,AND YOU'RE WRONG, AND THAT'S ALL THERE IS TO IT."     ERNIE THOUGHT A MOMENT. "SOUNDS TO ME LIKE YOU'RE BEING A BITDOGMATIC TO ME."     "YOU FOOL!" STERNO BARKED. "YOU DON'T EVEN HAVE THE VAGUESTIDEA WHAT'S GOING ON HERE! YOU'RE A FINE ONE TO TALK!"     CAPTAIN MEMORY ABRUPTLY CHANGED THE SUBXECT. "WANNA WATCH SOMETV?"      ERNIE REALLY DIDN'T WANT TO WATCH ANY TV, BUT HE WAS FEELINGVERY UNCOMFORTABLE WITH THE CURRENT DRIFT OF THE CONVERSATION.MAYBE WATCHING TV WOULD BE A GOOD WAY TO CHANGE THE SUBXECT.     "UH, THIS ISN'T GONNA BE LIKE LAST TIME, IS IT? WE'RE NOTGOING TO GET SUCKED INTO THE TV SHOW AGAIN, ARE WE?"     "NAW," THE CAPTAIN ASSURED HIM. "THAT WAS A FLUKE. ONE-IN-A-MILLION CHANCE. IT'LL NEVER HAPPEN AGAIN."     "WELL, OKAY THEN," ERNIE AGREED RELUCTANTLY.     CAPTAIN MEMORY RETURNED TO THE HARPSICHORD. "UM, F-SHARP?" HEHIT THE APPROPRIATE KEYS. THE CEILING VIEW-SCREEN SUDDENLY CHANGEDFROM A VIEW OF SPACE TO A TELEVISION PICTURE. THEY SEEMED TO HAVETUNED IN TO A COMMERCIAL.     THE ANNOUNCER WAS AN DOUR LOOKING MAN WEARING A BROWN MILITARYUNIFORM AND XACKBOOTS. HE SEEMED TO BE MAKING A STRENUOUS EFFORT TOBE CHEERFUL.     "HI, I'M MARTIN BOHRMANN," THE ANNOUNCER HELD UP TWO RECORDALBUMS. "AND IF YOU REMEMBER ME, YOU REMEMBER HITLER'S GREATESTHITS!"     "I DON'T REMEMBER THAT," SAID ERNIE TO NO-ONE IN PARTICULAR.     "NOW, TOGETHER AT LAST ON THESE TWO LONG-PLAYING RECORDALBUMS, 50 ALL-TIME GOLDEN HITS FROM THE THIRD REICH! YOU GET THEGESTAPO GLEE CLUB WITH HEIL HITLER, DEAR!" MILITARY-SOUNDING MUSICSTARTED UP IN THE BACKGROUND.     "DO WE HAVE TO WATCH THIS?" ERNIE COMPLAINED.     "...YOU CAN'T BUY THESE RECORDS IN ANY STORE, BUT IF YOU CALLTHIS NUMBER, A SECRET MESSENGER WILL KNOCK ON YOUR DOOR IN THEMIDDLE OF THE NIGHT AND..."     "OH, OKAY, I'LL CHANGE IT." CAPTAIN MEMORY STRUCK A KEY ON THEHARPSICHORD. THE SCREEN CHANGED TO BLACK-AND-WHITE. CHARACTERS IN1950'S CLOTHING APPEARED.     "IT'S AN OLD MOVIE," ERNIE COMMENTED. HE FELT BETTER. AN OLDMOVIE; THAT WOULD BE SAFE, RIGHT? NOTHING BAD COULD HAPPEN OUT OFAN OLD MOVIE, RIGHT?     A MAN IN A SUIT WITH A CLOTH OVER HIS HEAD APPEARED ON THESCREEN. A PRETTY YOUNG WOMAN CAME UP TO HIM, AND SUDDENLY YANKEDTHE CLOTH AWAY. UNDER THE CLOTH, THE MAN HAD THE TREMENDOUSLYENLARGED HEAD OF A FLY, COMPLETE WITH HUGE, MULTIFACETED EYES,ANTENNAE, AND A LONG BLACK SNOUT. THE YOUNG WOMAN BEGAN TO SCREAM.     "HEY, I REMEMBER THIS!" SAID ERNIE BRIGHTLY. IT'S THE FLY -THE ORIGINAL VERSION, TOO. YOU KNOW, THAT MOVIE ABOUT THE SCIENTISTWHO GOES INTO A MATTER TRANSMITTER, EXCEPT A FLY GETS IN IT, AND HEWINDS UP WITH THE HEAD OF A FLY? HEY, THIS IS A GREAT MOVIE!" ERNIESETTLED BACK TO WATCH, PLEASED THAT HE COULD FINALLY WATCHSOMETHING HE UNDERSTOOD.     THE MOVIE CUT TO A COMMERCIAL. "HI, I'M MARTIN BOHRMANN, ANDIF YOU REMEMBER ME..."     ERNIE MOANED. I WISH THEY WOULDN'T KEEP RUNNING THE SAMECOMMERCIAL, HE THOUGHT.     THE COMMERCIAL ENDED. "AND NOW, BACK TO THE DATING GAME!"     "THE DATING GAME!" ERNIE SAT BOLT UPRIGHT. "I DON'T WANNAWATCH THE DATING GAME! WHAT HAPPENED TO MY MOVIE?!"     CAPTAIN MEMORY LOOKED UP. "OH, A GAME SHOW!" HE SAID BRIGHTLY.HE HADN'T BEEN PAYING MUCH ATTENTION UP TO THIS POINT. "I LIKE GAMESHOWS! YOU KNOW, YOU CAN REALLY GET INTO GAME SHOWS!"     "I KNOW," ERNIE INTERRUPTED. "THAT'S WHAT I'M AFRAID OF!"     THE MAN ON THE SCREEN LOOKED LIKE A TYPICAL GAME SHOW HOST,WEARING A PLAID POLYESTER SUIT WITH A LARGE CARNATION IN HIS LAPEL.THE ONLY THING THAT SEEMED A BIT ODD ABOUT HIM IS THAT HE WASWEARING XACKBOOTS AND A MONOCLE.     "CONGRATULATIONS!" HE WAS SAYING TO AN EXCITED FEMALECONTESTANT. "YOU'FE VON AN ALL-EXPENSES-PAID DREAM DATE VITBACHELOR NUMBER 3!" THE GAME SHOW HOST SEEMED TO HAVE A BIT OF AGERMAN ACCENT.     "OH, I XUST CAN'T WAIT TO SEE HIM!" THE YOUNG WOMAN WASXUMPING UP AND DOWN WITH EXCITEMENT.      "BACHELOR NUMBER THREE, COME ON OUT!" THE GAME SHOW HOSTCALLED OUT. A DOOR OPENED, AND OUT STEPPED A MAN, WEARING A SUIT,WHO HAD THE ENORMOUSLY ENLARGED HEAD OF A FLY. THE YOUNG WOMANBEGAN TO SCREAM.     ERNIE LOOKED CONFUSED. "HEY, WHAT ARE WE WATCHING, ANYWAY? ISTHIS THE FLY, OR THE DATING GAME, OR WHAT?"     CAPTAIN MEMORY WAS LOOKING AT THE TV GUIDE UPSIDE-DOWN. "MMMHMM," HE AGREED, NOT PAYING MUCH ATTENTION.     THE HOST SEEMED TO BE WRAPPING THE SHOW UP. "VELL FOLKS, DISIS BIFF MOXXARELLA, SAYING..."     "WAIT A MINUTE" STERNO INTERRUPTED. "I THINK SOMETHING SMELLSAROUND HERE!     CAPTAIN MEMORY LOOKED UP. "GOT A PROBLEM?" HE ASKEDUNCONCERNEDLY.     "THINK ABOUT IT," STERNO CONSIDERED. "HIS NAME: MOXXARELLA."     "HUH?" SAID ERNIE. "YOU MEAN, BIFF?"     "THIS GUY'S NAME IS MOXXARELLA," STERNO NOTED. "THE LAST GUYSNAME WAS LIEDERKRANX."     "SO?" ASKED ERNIE UNCOMPREHENDINGLY.     "CHEESE, GET IT?" CRIED STERNO. "THEY'RE BOTH CHEESE!"      I DON'T THINK I LIKE THE SOUND OF THIS, ERNIE THOUGHT. "UM,WELL, YOU KNOW," HE BEGAN TO CAPTAIN MEMORY. "MAYBE WE OUGHT TOGIVE THIS SOME CONSIDERATION..."     BUT IT WAS TOO LATE. WITH A DEAFENING ROAR, THE DELICATE PANELDOORS TO THE ROOM WERE BLOWN OFF THEIR HINGES. A DOXEN ARMED MENRUSHED IN, POINTING WICKED-LOOKING WEAPONS AT THE TRIO. "FREEXE!"ONE OF THEM SHOUTED.     CAPTAIN MEMORY LOOKED UNCOMPREHENDING. "IT SEEMS A BIT WARMFOR THAT," HE COMMENTED.     THE GROUP OF ARMED MEN PARTED TO MAKE WAY FOR AN UNPLEASANTLOOKING MAN WEARING A BLACK MILITARY UNIFORM, XACKBOOTS, AND AMONOCLE. "XO, VE MEET AGAIN!"     THE MAN, DID, IN FACT, LOOK SOMEWHAT FAMILIAR TO ERNIE."HAVEN'T I SEEN YOU SOMEWHERE BEFORE?"     THE MAN SMILED WARMLY. "NO DOUBT YOU'VE SEEN MY TV SHOW. THETORTURE GAME IS A BIG HIT THESE DAYS. I'M..." HE DREW HIMSELF UP TOHIS FULL HEIGHT. "STURMBANNFUHRER DR. HEINX VON LIEDERKRANX, THEGESTAPO'S GREATEST." HE PAUSED; HE SEEMED TO BE WAITING FORAPPLAUSE. HIS MEN LOOKED AT EACH OTHER ZUICKLY, AND BEGAN CLAPPING.ERNIE THOUGHT IT MIGHT BE A GOOD IDEA IF HE APPLAUDED TOO.     "ENOUGH!" VON LIEDERKRANX SILENCED HIS MEN WITH A ZUICK SWEEPOF HIS RIDING CROP, LEAVING ERNIE APPLAUDING FEEBLY ALL BY HIMSELF.ERNIE LOOKED AROUND, AND ZUICKLY STOPPED.     VON LIEDERKRANX PRODDED CAPTAIN MEMORY IN THE CHEST WITH HISRIDING CROP. "NOW! YOU WILL TELL US YOUR NAME, RANK AND SERIALNUMBER!"     "MY WHAT?" CAPTAIN MEMORY LOOKED UNCOMPREHENDING.     "YOUR NAME, RANK, AND SERIAL NUMBER!"     "NAME, RANK AND CEREAL NUMBER?" MUSED THE CAPTAIN. "BUT INEVER EVEN EAT CEREAL."     "DO NOT BE COY WITH US!" SNAPPED THE STURMBANNFUHRER. "WE KNOWYOU ARE ONE OF THEM! VE KNOW YOU ARE A SPY ON A MISSION OF SABOTAGEAND DESTRUCTION!" HE PAUSED CALCULATINGLY. "REMEMBER, VE HAVE VAYSOF MAKING YOU TALK!"     ERNIE TURNED TO CAPTAIN MEMORY IN CONFUSION. "WHO ARE THESEGUYS, ANYWAY?"     "THEY LOOK LIKE A BUNCH OF NAXIS," THE CAPTAIN REPLIEDTHOUGHTFULLY. "BUT THEY COULD BE..."     "ENOUGH!" VON LIEDERKRANX BROKE IN. "YOU VILL ANSWER OURZUESTIONS!"     CAPTAIN MEMORY CONCENTRATED. "HOW ABOUT: WHO PUT THE BOP INTHE BOP-SHU-BOP-SHU-BOP?" HE SUGGESTED.     VON LIEDERKRANX'S TONE ABRUPTLY CHANGED. "YOU KNOW," HE TURNEDTO CAPTAIN MEMORY. "VE DO NOT HAFF TO BE ENEMIES. VE COULD BEFRIENDS. YOU VOULD LIKE TO BE FRIENDS, NEIN?"     "SURE." CAPTAIN MEMORY WAS NOTHING IF NOT AGREEABLE.     "THEN TELL US VOT VE VANT TO KNOW!"     "OKAY." THE CAPTAIN THOUGHT A MINUTE. "THE ATTACK IS SET FOREXACTLY 10:30. XULIUS CAESAR WILL MARCH ON OMAHA, AND THEENTERPRISE WILL ATTACK THE TITANIC SOMEWHERE IN THE SOUTH CHINASEA. THEN PATTON WILL DRIVE UP THROUGH THE SOUTH OF FRANCE, MAKE ARIGHT ONTO ROUTE 66, GO DOWN THREE STOP LIGHTS, TURN RIGHT AND IT'STHE THIRD HOUSE FROM THE CORNER."     "XUST AS VE THOUGHT!" THIS, OF COURSE, WAS NOT WHAT THESTURMBANNFUHRER HAD THOUGHT AT ALL. HOWEVER, HE HAD TO MAINTAIN AGOOD APPEARANCE IN FRONT OF HIS MEN. HE SMILED AMIABLY. "PLEASE GOON!"     CAPTAIN MEMORY DECIDED IT WAS TIME TO STOP. "I THINK I'VE SAIDTOO MUCH ALREADY!"     VON LIEDERKRANX'S FACE TURNED HARD. "YOU MISUNDERSTAND," HESAID MENACINGLY. "I'M NOT ASKING YOU, I'M TELLING YOU! TALK! NOW!!"     "I'D REALLY RATHER NOT." CAPTAIN MEMORY DIDN'T SEEM TO BE TOOUPSET BY THE PROCEEDINGS. ERNIE, HOWEVER, WAS BEGINNING TO SWEAT.STERNO WAS GLARING AT THE OTHER TWO, GIVING THEM AN I-TOLD-YOU-SOLOOK.     VON LIEDERKRANX SMILED SADISTICALLY. "YOU CAN'T ESCAPE, YOUKNOW. VE HAFF TOTAL CONTROL OF ALL COMPUTATION IN XIS SECTOR. XESYSTEM VILL NOT ACCEPT COMMANDS FROM ANYONE BUT ME. DERE IS NO VAYOUT. VE HAVE YOU VHERE VE VANT YOU!"         "WELL," CAPTAIN MEMORY BEGAN. "I'M AFRAID I DON'T HAVETIME..."     "SO BE IT!" CRIED VON LIEDERKRANX. "IF DAT'S DE VAY YOU AREGOING TO BE - BRING ON DE HOT VHIRLING CORKSCREW!"     CAPTAIN MEMORY LOOKED PAINED. "YOU KNOW, I REALLY DON'T CAREFOR THE HOT VHIRLING...I MEAN `WHIRLING' CORKSCREW."     VON LIEDERKRANX LAUGHED SADISTICALLY. "YOU ARE VERY FUNNY. VEVILL SEE HOW FUNNY YOU VILL BE AFTER A FEW HOURS VIT MEINCORKSCREW!"     CAPTAIN MEMORY SEEMED OFFENDED. "WELL, IF YOU'RE GOING TO BELIKE THAT, I'M SIMPLY GOING TO HAVE TO LEAVE."     VON LIEDERKRANX LAUGHED SADISTICALLY, AGAIN. IN FACT, HEDIDN'T SEEM TO BE ABLE TO LAUGH ANY OTHER WAY. "DERE IS NO WAYOUT!" VON LIEDERKRANX CONTINUED. "YOU CANNOT BREAK INTO XE SYSTEMFROM HERE!"     ERNIE NOTICED HIS STOMACH BEGINNING TO HURT AGAIN. STRESS, HETHOUGHT. IT'S NOT GOOD FOR ME TO BE UNDER THIS MUCH STRESS. I THINKIT'S AFFECTING MY HEALTH. MAYBE I'M GETTING AN ULCER?     VON LIEDERKRANX SWITCHED ON HIS HOT WHIRLING CORKSCREW, WHICH,TRUE TO IT'S NAME BEGAN TO WHIRL AND GLOW. LAUGHING SADISTICALLY,AS USUAL, HE BEGAN TO BRING IT CLOSER AND CLOSER TO CAPTAINMEMORY'S FACE.     THE TORTURE DEVICE EDGED EVER NEARER, INCH BY INCH, SPINNINGAND HISSING AS IT APPROACHED CAPTAIN MEMORY'S UNPROTECTED FACE.ERNIE SHUT HIS EYES TIGHTLY. IT'S TOO HORRIBLE, HE THOUGHT. I CAN'TWATCH. HE WAITED FOR THE INEVITABLE SCREAMS.     CAPTAIN MEMORY LOOKED MIFFED. "OKAY, BE LIKE THAT! XMP 08F1!"     ERNIE OPENED HIS EYES. THE ROCOCO SITTING ROOM HAD VANISHED.THEY SEEMED TO BE BACK IN THE HUGE CHICAGO LIVING ROOM THAT THEYHAD ORIGINALLY FOUND THEMSELVES IN AFTER LEAVING THE SIMULATIONARCADE. ERNIE'S HEAD SWAM. THIS IS ALL CHANGING TOO FAST FOR ME, HETHOUGHT. I XUST CAN'T KEEP UP WITH IT. HE FOUND A CHAIR AND SATDOWN. ERNIE DIDN'T FEEL WELL AT ALL.       CAPTAIN MEMORY WAS STROLLING AROUND, RUEFULLY INSPECTING THESURROUNDINGS. "LOOK AT THIS PLACE," HE LAMENTED. "WHAT A MESS!"     ERNIE LOOKED ABOUT. THE PLACE, WAS, IN FACT, IN DISMAL SHAPE.THE WALLS WERE COVERED WITH SOOT, THE FURNITURE WAS SINGED. MUCH OFTHE FURNITURE WAS KNOCKED OVER; SOME WAS TOTALLY SPLINTERED. ITLOOKED RATHER LIKE A BOMB HAD GONE OFF IN THE ROOM. ERNIE RECOVEREDENOUGH COMPOSURE TO SPEAK. "WHY...WHY ARE WE BACK HERE?"     "OH, I APOLOGIXE FOR THAT,"  CAPTAIN MEMORY EXPLAINED. "I XUSTCOULDN'T THINK OF ANYPLACE ELSE ON SUCH SHORT NOTICE. I SHOULD HAVEKNOWN THIS PLACE WOULD BE A MESS."     ERNIE LOOKED AROUND. "YEAH, THIS PLACE HAS REALLY GONE TO THEDOGS."      "I SUPPOSE YOU THINK THAT'S FUNNY!" STERNO GROWLED.      ERNIE NOTICED TWO PILES OF BURNED RAGS LYING NEAR THE TV SET.THEY WERE STILL SMOLDERING SLIGHTLY. HE SHUDDERED. HE WOULD RATHERNOT THINK ABOUT WHAT MIGHT HAVE HAPPENED HERE.     "WELL...WELL," ERNIE STARTED AGAIN. "HOW DID WE GET HERE? THATNAXI SAID WE COULDN'T ESCAPE. HE SAID THEY CONTROLLED ALLCOMPUTATION IN THE SECTOR!"     "THAT'S RIGHT, CAPTAIN MEMORY SMILED. "WE XUMPED TO ADIFFERENT SECTOR!"     ERNIE DECIDED TO XUST ACCEPT THAT EXPLANATION, EVEN THOUGH HEDIDN'T ENTIRELY UNDERSTAND IT.     "MAKES ABOUT AS MUCH SENSE AS ANYTHING ELSE," STERNO AGREED.HE SEEMED TO HAVE FOUND ANOTHER CIGAR, AND WAS PUFFING AWAY ON ITCONTENTEDLY. HE SEEMED TO BE IN A MUCH BETTER MOOD WHENEVER HE HADA CIGAR. "PITY YOU COULDN'T HAVE TRANSPORTED THAT BRANDY ALONG WITHUS, THOUGH."     ERNIE WAS DESPERATELY TRYING TO MAKE SENSE OF ALL OF THIS."SO, WHO WERE THOSE NAXI GUYS, ANYWAY?"     "THAT'S HARD TO SAY FOR SURE," CM SAID THOUGHTFULLY. "THEY'REPROBABLY CYBERSLAVES, XUST LIKE YOU WOULD HAVE BEEN IF I HADN'TRESCUED YOU."     ERNIE SHUDDERED. HE REALLY DIDN'T LIKE THE SOUND OF THAT`CYBERSLAVE' STUFF."     "WHAT ABOUT THEIR LEADER, VON LIEDERKRANX?" STERNO WONDERED."HE DIDN'T LOOK A SLAVE. IN FACT, HE SEEMED TO BE HAVING A REALLYGOOD TIME!"     THE CAPTAIN NODDED. "I'M SURE HE'S NOT A SLAVE," HE AGREED."HE'S ONE OF THE SLAVEMASTERS. IN FACT," CAPTAIN MEMORY FURLED HISBROW IN THOUGHT. "HE MIGHT EVEN BE WALDO STADIUM HIMSELF!"      "SO, WHAT ARE WE DOING IN ALL OF THIS?" ERNIE WANTED TO KNOW.     STERNO ROLLED HIS EYES UPWARD. "HOPELESS!"     "DON'T PICK ON THE KID!" CAPTAIN MEMORY DEFENDED ERNIE.     "YEAH!" ERNIE AGREED.     "AFTER ALL," CAPTAIN MEMORY CONTINUED. "IT'S NOT HIS FAULTHE'S STUPID!"     "YEAH, IT'S..." ERNIE BROKE OFF. THAT WASN'T TURNING OUT THEWAY HE'D HOPED.      STERNO LOOKED AT THE CAPTAIN. "SO, WHAT KIND OF SUPER HERO AREYOU SUPPOSED TO BE, ANYWAY?"     "ME?" CAPTAIN MEMORY EXPOUNDED. "WHY I'M A STRANGE VISITORFROM ANOTHER PLANET WHO CAME TO EARTH WITH POWERS AND ABILITIES FARBEYOND THOSE OF MORTAL MEN."     "POWERS AND ABILITIES?" ERNIE WANTED TO KNOW. "LIKE WHAT?"     CAPTAIN MEMORY CONTINUED EXPANSIVELY. "I'M FASTER THAN ASPEEDING BULLET, MORE POWERFUL THAN A LOCOMOTIVE; WHY, I CAN EVENLEAP TALL BUILDINGS IN A SINGLE BOUND!"     THIS WAS BEGINNING TO SOUND A BIT FAMILIAR TO ERNIE. "ANYTHINGELSE?"     "I CAN ALSO CHANGE THE COURSE OF MIGHTY RIVERS AND BEND STEELIN MY BARE HANDS."     I'VE GOT IT NOW, THOUGHT ERNIE. "YOU DON'T, BY ANY CHANCE,TEND TO GO AROUND DISGUISED AS CLARK KENT, MILD-MANNERED REPORTERFOR A GREAT METROPOLITAN NEWSPAPER, AND FIGHT A NEVER-ENDING BATTLEFOR TRUTH, XUSTICE, AND THE AMERICAN WAY, DO YOU?"     CAPTAIN MEMORY LOOKED TOTALLY MYSTIFIED. "WHY, NO. WHY WOULDI WANT TO DO A THING LIKE THAT?"     ERNIE WAS NONPLUSSED. "WELL...I DUNNO. I XUST SORT OFTHOUGHT..." HE TRAILED OFF.     THERE WAS AN AWKWARD SILENCE. STERNO CLEARED HIS THROAT. "YOUDON'T SUPPOSE THESE PEOPLE KEEP CAVIAR ABOUT SOMEWHERE, DO YOU?"     GRATEFUL FOR THE INTERRUPTION, ERNIE BEGAN SEARCHING. HE FOUNDA SMALL WHITE CABINET THAT LOOKED LIKE IT MIGHT BE A REFRIGERATOR."AH!" HE PULLED OUT A SMALL XAR. "HOW'S THIS?"     STERNO EXAMINED THE XAR RUEFULLY. "OH," HE SNIFFED. "AMERICANCAVIAR. WELL, I SUPPOSE BELUGA WAS A BIT TOO MUCH TO ASK. WE'LLXUST HAVE TO ROUGH IT, I IMAGINE." HE LOOKED AROUND. "YOU WOULDN'THAPPEN TO HAVE A SLICE OF FRESH ONION, BY ANY CHANCE?"     CAPTAIN MEMORY HAD RETURNED TO PERUSING THE TV GUIDE. "WANNAWATCH SOME TV?" HE ASKED BRIGHTLY. "IT'S ALMOST TIME FOR THAT GREATGAME SHOW ABOUT THE DINOSAUR AGE."     "WHICH ONE IS THAT?" ERNIE COULDN'T RECALL ANY SHOWS ABOUTDINOSAURS.     "OH, I'M SURE YOU'VE SEEN IT. IT'S REAL FAMOUS!" THE CAPTAINEXPLAINED. "IT'S CALLED YOU BET XURASSIC!"     ERNIE FROWNED. SOMETHING ABOUT THAT NAME DID SEEM A BITFAMILIAR. ALL THESE FAMILIAR-SOUNDING THINGS THAT HE COULDN'T ZUITEPLACE WERE MAKING HIM VERY UNEASY.      SUDDENLY, THE TELEVISION CAME ON. "PREPARE TO DIE, INFERIORCREATURES!" THE SPEAKER BLARED.     ERNIE WAS ANNOYED. "I THOUGHT WE TURNED THAT OFF!"     CAPTAIN MEMORY LOOKED UPSET. "OH, DEAR. I FORGOT ABOUT THAT!"     ERNIE BEGAN TO GET THAT ZUEASY FEELING IN HIS STOMACH AGAIN."FORGOT ABOUT WHAT?"     THE TELEVISION SCREEN SHOWED A HUGE PURPLE VEGETABLE, LIFTINGITSELF UP ON A GREEN STALK. IT SEEMED TO BE GLOATING, INSOFAR AS AVEGETABLE CAN GLOAT. "YOU WILL SOON RESPIRE YOUR LAST, ANIMALSCUM!" THE VEGETABLE CONTINUED. "NO LONGER SHALL WE OF THEVEGETABLE KINGDOM BE YOUR HELPLESS VICTIMS, TO BE BRED ANDDESTROYED AT YOUR WHIMS! THE DAY OF RECKONING IS HERE AT LAST!PREPARE TO RECEIVE THE VENGEANCE OF THE VEGETABLES!"     ERNIE SHIFTED HIS WEIGHT UNCOMFORTABLY. "THIS SURE IS A WEIRDPROGRAM."     "OH, IT'S NOT A PROGRAM," CAPTAIN MEMORY EXPLAINED. "THEKILLER EGGPLANTS ARE ABOUT TO ATTACK!"     ERNIE THOUGHT HE'D BETTER SIT DOWN AGAIN. "HUH?"     "I TOLD YOU, WE'RE IN A GAME CALLED `ATTACK OF THE KILLEREGGPLANTS'!" CAPTAIN MEMORY REGARDED HIS BARE WRIST. "OH DEAR, IT'SBEEN ALMOST FORTY-FIVE MINUTES."     ERNIE DIDN'T GET IT. "I DON'T GET IT," HE SAID.     "REMEMBER THOSE NUKES I TOLD YOU ABOUT?"     ERNIE DIDN'T LIKE THE SOUND OF THIS. HE TRIED TO PUT THEPIECES TOGETHER. "THEY'RE GOING TO NUKE US?"     "AFRAID SO," SAID CAPTAIN MEMORY CHEERILY. HE DIDN'T SEEMPARTICULARLY UPSET AT THE IDEA.     "WHY?!"     "TO PUT AN END TO THE REVOLT OF THE VEGETABLES," CAPTAINMEMORY EXPLAINED. "AND FRY THE GREAT EGGPLANT ONCE AND FOR ALL!"     ERNIE WAS TRYING HARD TO UNDERSTAND ALL OF THIS. "LET ME GETTHIS STRAIGHT - YOU MEAN THE VEGETABLES HAVE RISEN UP IN REVOLT?"     "OF COURSE NOT!" CAPTAIN MEMORY LAUGHED. "HOW COULD VEGETABLESPOSSIBLY DO A THING LIKE THAT?"     ERNIE WAS GETTING FRUSTRATED. "THEN WHAT IS GOING ON!?"     CAPTAIN MEMORY CHUCKLED. "OH, IT'S ALL A BIG PRACTICAL XOKE!"     ERNIE FELT RELIEVED. "THEN THEY'RE NOT GOING TO NUKE CHICAGO?"     "OH NO, THEY'RE REALLY GOING TO DO IT." CAPTAIN MEMORY SEEMEDTO THINK THIS WAS ALL VERY FUNNY. "AFTER ALL, THEY DON'T KNOW IT'SA XOKE, DO THEY? IT WOULDN'T BE VERY FUNNY IF THEY KNEW IT WAS AXOKE, WOULD IT?" CAPTAIN MEMORY CHUCKLED. "NOPE, THEY'RE GOING TOBOMB THE WHOLE CITY BACK TO THE STONE AGE."     ERNIE HEARD THE SOUND OF XETS FLYING VERY CLOSE BY OUTSIDE. HEBEGAN TO FEEL VERY UNEASY. "SO, UM, WHAT ARE WE GOING TO DO?"     "DO?" ASKED CAPTAIN MEMORY INNOCENTLY.     ERNIE BEGAN TO FEEL AN INTENSE HEAT RADIATING THROUGH THEWALLS. HE CLENCHED HIS EYES TIGHTLY CLOSED. I'LL XUST CLOSE MYEYES, HE THOUGHT. MAYBE WHEN I OPEN THEM AGAIN THIS WILL ALL BEGONE.     HE OPENED HIS EYES.     IT WAS ALL GONE.     ERNIE WAS TAKEN ABACK. WOW, HE THOUGHT. IT WORKED.     HE LOOKED AROUND. THEY WERE IN THE MIDST OF A GRASSY FIELD,STUDDED WITH WILDFLOWERS. BRIGHT SUNSHINE BATHED THE SCENE. CAPTAINMEMORY WAS IDLY TOYING WITH BLADES OF GRASS; STERNO WAS SNIFFINGTHE FLOWERS.     "WHERE ARE WE?" ERNIE ASKED DUMBLY.     "WHY, THE STONE AGE, OF COURSE." CAPTAIN MEMORY SEEMED TOTHINK THIS WAS ZUITE OBVIOUS. "SOMEWHERE IN THE XURASSIC PERIOD, ITHINK."     "YOU KNEW THIS WOULD HAPPEN?" ERNIE CRIED.     "SURE," REPLIED THE CAPTAIN OFFHANDEDLY. "IT'S PART OF THEGAME!"     ERNIE SIGHED. A GENTLE BREEXE SWAYED THE TALL GRASS. HE COULDHEAR BIRDSONGS IN THE DISTANCE. IT ALL SEEMED VERY PEACEFUL. GOOD,THOUGHT ERNIE. I COULD USE A BREAK. HE LAY DOWN IN THE GRASS ANDRESTED. AT LEAST, HE THOUGHT, WE WON'T HAVE TO WATCH ANY TV.     THE SUN MOVED SLOWLY ACROSS THE SKY AS THE HOURS PASSED. AFTERA TIME, ERNIE SAT UP. IT OCCURRED TO HIM THAT HE MIGHT BE GETTINGA SUNBURN. "SO, WHAT ARE WE GONNA DO IN THE STONE AGE?" HE ASKED.      "GET STONED?" STERNO OFFERED.     CAPTAIN MEMORY LOOKED AT HIS BARE WRIST. "I'M GLAD YOUMENTIONED THAT," HE SAID. "IT'S TIME WE WERE ON OUR WAY."     I KNEW I SHOULDN'T HAVE SAID ANYTHING, ERNIE THOUGHT. OH WELL,IT'S TOO LATE NOW. "SO NOW WHAT?"     "WE'D BETTER FIND A CAVE BEFORE IT GETS DARK, DON'T YOUTHINK?" CAPTAIN MEMORY SAID CHEERILY. "WOULDN'T WANT TO HAVE A RUN-IN WITH ONE OF THOSE SABER-TOOTH TIGERS, WOULD WE?"      ERNIE FROWNED. HE HAD FORGOTTEN THAT THERE WOULD BE THINGSLIKE SABER-TOOTH TIGERS IN THE STONE AGE, ALTHOUGH HE SUPPOSED HESHOULD HAVE REALIXED THAT. IT SUDDENLY OCCURRED TO HIM THAT STONEAGE CAVES OFTEN HELD GIANT CAVE BEARS. "UM, MAYBE WE SHOULD THINKABOUT THIS," HE CALLED OUT TO CAPTAIN MEMORY. THE CAPTAIN, HOWEVER,WAS ALREADY FAR AHEAD OF ERNIE, STRIDING PURPOSEFULLY TOWARDS ARIDGE OF WHITE CLIFFS IN THE DISTANCE. HE SEEMED NOT TO HEAR ERNIE,OR, IF HE DID, HE PAID NO ATTENTION. ERNIE HURRIED TO CATCH UP.     "AT LEAST YOU'RE PROPERLY DRESSED FOR THE OCCASION," STERNOCOMMENTED TO ERNIE. "I UNDERSTAND FUR LOINCLOTHS ARE ALL THE RAGETHIS YEAR." STERNO SNICKERED.     ERNIE LOOKED DOWN AT HIS GARMENT. HE HAD BEEN WEARING IT SOLONG HE HAD SORT OF FORGOTTEN ABOUT IT.     "IF WE RUN INTO ANY SABER-TOOTH TIGERS," STERNO CONTINUED."YOU CAN XUST CHOP THEM UP WITH YOUR PLASTIC BROADSWORD." STERNOLAUGHED UNPLEASANTLY.     "ARE YOU STILL CARRYING THAT THING?" CAPTAIN MEMORY CALLED,WITHOUT LOOKING BACK.     "HEY, IT'S A FORTY BUCK DEPOSIT, OKAY?" ERNIE SENSED THAT THEYWERE BOTH LAUGHING AT HIM. "GIMME A BREAK, HUH?"     "HOPELESS, XUST HOPELESS," STERNO MUTTERED, AMUSED.     ERNIE BEGAN TO BE ABLE TO MAKE OUT AN ODD LOOKING OBXECT INTHE DISTANCE. IT SEEMED TO BE SOME SORT OF PRIMITIVE BUILDING. ASTHEY APPROACHED, ERNIE BEGAN TO SEE IT MORE CLEARLY. IT SEEMED TOBE A HOUSE, MADE OUT OF HUGE SLABS OF STONE. HOLES WERE CUT IN THEFRONT SLAB FOR WINDOWS AND A DOOR. A HUGE FLAT SLAB MADE UP THEROOF. SITTING OUTSIDE THE HOUSE WAS A VERY ODD OBXECT. IT WAS AWOODEN FRAMEWORK CONNECTED TO TWO HUGE STONE ROLLERS. THERE WAS ASEAT ON THE FRAMEWORK, AND A PIECE OF FUR HELD UP ABOVE THE SEAT,CREATING A PRIMITIVE ROOF.     "HOW ODD," COMMENTED STERNO. "SOME SORT OF TOTEM OBXECT, NODOUBT. PERHAPS A THRONE OF SOME SORT?"     THEY APPROACHED THE HOUSE. IT BEGAN TO LOOK A BIT FAMILIAR TOERNIE. THOSE FUR CURTAINS ON THE WINDOWS, WHERE HAD HE SEEN THOSEBEFORE? A NEAT WALK LED TOWARD THE FRONT DOOR. AT THE END OF THEWALK WAS A STONE BOX, HELD UP ON A POLE. THERE WAS SOMETHINGWRITTEN ON THE BOX. THE NAME CONFIRMED ERNIE'S WORST FEARS: "F.FLINTSTONE".     "HEY GUYS!" ERNIE CALLED OUT.     "HMM?" RETURNED CAPTAIN MEMORY, CONTINUING TO WALK TOWARD THEHOUSE. HE WAS, AS USUAL, NOT PAYING MUCH ATTENTION TO ERNIE.     "UM, I DON'T THINK WE SHOULD GO IN THERE!"     "WHY NOT?" CAPTAIN MEMORY DID NOT EVEN SLOW DOWN.     "I'VE GOT A REAL BAD FEELING ABOUT THIS PLACE!"     "AWW, IS THE BIG, STRONG BARBARIAN AFRAID OF THE LITTLEHOUSE?" SNEERED STERNO. "WELL, THEN HE CAN XUST STAY OUT HERE WITHTHE SABER-TOOTH TIGERS IF HE LIKES." THE TWO OF THEM CONTINUED INTOTHE HOUSE, LEAVING ERNIE STANDING ALONE ON THE FRONT WALK. ERNIELOOKED AROUND. THE SUN WAS SLOWLY EDGING TOWARDS THE HORIXON,CASTING LONG, MENACING-LOOKING SHADOWS. ERNIE FOUND HIMSELFANXIOUSLY LOOKING AROUND FOR PLACES LARGE ENOUGH FOR A SABER-TOOTHTIGER TO HIDE IN. WELL, HE THOUGHT. THERE'S NOT MUCH POINT INSTANDING HERE. I MIGHT AS WELL GO IN.     STEPPING INSIDE THE DOORWAY, ERNIE FOUND HIMSELF IN A LIVINGROOM, APPOINTED WITH FURNITURE MADE OF STONE AND WOOD. CAPTAINMEMORY AND STERNO HAD MADE THEMSELVES COMFORTABLE ON THE STONE-AND-FUR SOFA. THE OWNERS OF THE HOUSE WERE NOWHERE IN SIGHT.     "RATHER LUXURIOUS FOR THE STONE AGE, DON'T YOU THINK?"COMMENTED STERNO. CAPTAIN MEMORY WAS, ONCE AGAIN, ENGROSSED IN HISCOPY OF THE TV GUIDE. ERNIE NOTICED, ACROSS FROM THE SOFA, WHATAPPEARED TO BE A ROUGHLY CARVED, STONE TELEVISION SET. HE MOANED.     "WHATEVER IS THE MATTER!" SAID STERNO IMPATIENTLY.     "HEY GUYS," ERNIE IMPLORED. "I REALLY THINK WE OUGHT TO GETOUT OF HERE. I THINK THIS IS SOME KIND OF A TRAP, OR SOMETHING."     STERNO ROLLED HIS EYES UPWARD. "PARANOIA," HE COMMENTED. "THEPOOR CREATURE WOULD LIKE TO THINK HE'S IMPORTANT ENOUGH FOR ANYONETO BOTHER PERSECUTING." HE TURNED TO ERNIE. "WHO IN THE WORLD WOULDWANT TO LAY A TRAP FOR YOU? WHAT POSSIBLE USE COULD THEY HAVE FORYOU IF THEY CAUGHT YOU?"     ERNIE SHIFTED BACK AND FORTH UNCOMFORTABLY. SUDDENLY, ANOBXECT CAUGHT HIS EYE. "PARANOIA, HUH?" HE DEMANDED. "WHAT ABOUTTHAT!" HE POINTED TO AN OBXECT IN A DARK CORNER.     ERNIE'S EXCLAMATION WAS ENOUGH TO TEAR CAPTAIN MEMORY'SATTENTION AWAY FROM HIS TV GUIDE. HE PEERED AT THE OBXECT. IT WASA BOX WITH WHAT APPEARED TO BE A LENS ATTACHED TO IT. AS THEYLOOKED AT IT, IT WHIRRED ZUIETLY, MOVING THE LENS BACK AND FORTH.     "IT'S A HIDDEN CAMERA!" ERNIE CRIED TRIUMPHANTLY. "WE'RE BEINGWATCHED!"     STERNO WAS NONPLUSSED. "WHERE DID THAT COME FROM?"     "WELL, TEAR IT OUT, THEN!" CAPTAIN MEMORY SAID.     ERNIE STRODE OVER TO THE DARK CORNER, GRABBED TO CAMERA ANDYANKED IT OUT OF IT'S MOUNTING. HE DASHED IT TO THE GROUND, WHEREIT SHATTERED, REVEALING FEEBLY GLOWING ELECTRONIC PARTS WHICHSLOWLY, ONE BY ONE, WENT OUT.     "WELL, SO MUCH FOR THAT," CAPTAIN MEMORY RETURNED TO THE TVGUIDE.      "IS THAT ALL?!" EXCLAIMED ERNIE.     "WELL, WHAT ELSE DID YOU WANT?" ASKED CAPTAIN MEMORY,MYSTIFIED.     "LOOK, I XUST PROVED TO YOU THAT THIS IS SOME KIND OF A TRAPOR SOMETHING!" CRIED ERNIE EXASPERATEDLY. "THERE WAS A HIDDENCAMERA WATCHING US, FOR HEAVEN'S SAKE!"     "SO, YOU TOOK IT OUT." CAPTAIN MEMORY SEEMED PERFECTLYSATISFIED. "SO MUCH FOR THAT."     ERNIE WAS GETTING VERY FRUSTRATED. "WELL, WELL, WHAT IFTHERE'S ANOTHER?"     "OH, I VERY MUCH DOUBT THAT," STERNO COMMENTED.     CAPTAIN MEMORY WAS STILL STUDYING HIS TV GUIDE. "WANNA WATCHSOME TV?" HE ASKED BRIGHTLY.     "NO!" ERNIE WAS BUILDING UP A REAL AVERSION TO TELEVISION.     "WHY NOT?" CAPTAIN MEMORY COULDN'T IMAGINE WHY ANYONE WOULDNOT WANT TO WATCH TV.     "LOOK," SAID ERNIE DESPERATELY. "THIS IS THE STONE AGE, RIGHT?THERE AREN'T SUPPOSED TO BE ANY TVS HERE. THEY HAVEN'T BEENINVENTED YET. THIS IS BEFORE TELEVISION!"     CAPTAIN MEMORY CHUCKLED.  "DON'T BE SILLY! NO TIME IS BEFORETELEVISION!" HE GOT UP AND WALKED OVER TO THE SET.     "HOW PRIMITIVE," STERNO COMMENTED. "NO REMOTE CONTROL. THAT'SONLY TO BE EXPECTED IN THE STONE AGE, I SUPPOSE."     "LOOK," SAID ERNIE URGENTLY. "I'M POSITIVE THERE WERE NOTELEVISIONS IN THE STONE AGE!"     CAPTAIN MEMORY SIGHED. "BE REASONABLE," HE SAID. "HAVE YOUEVER SEEN, OH, LET'S SAY `I WAS A TEENAGE CAVEMAN'?"     ERNIE THOUGHT A MOMENT. "UM, YES."     "WHERE DID YOU SEE IT?"     "ON TV."     "IT TAKES PLACE IN THE STONE AGE, RIGHT?"     "UM, YEAH." ERNIE WASN'T SURE HE LIKED THE WAY THIS LINE OFZUESTIONING WAS GOING.     "WELL, HOW COULD THAT BE, UNLESS THERE WERE TELEVISIONS IN THESTONE AGE!?" CAPTAIN MEMORY CRIED TRIUMPHANTLY. "I REST MY CASE."     STERNO APPLAUDED. "BRAVO," HE SAID POLITELY.     "WELL...WELL..." ERNIE WAS SURE THERE WAS SOMETHING WRONG WITHTHIS ARGUMENT, BUT HE COULDN'T ZUITE FIGURE OUT WHAT IT WAS. HENOTICED THAT NO-ONE WAS LISTENING TO HIM ANYWAY.     CAPTAIN MEMORY SWITCHED ON THE TELEVISION. BEING A PRIMITIVESET, IT TOOK A LONG TIME TO WARM UP.     A PICTURE OF A ROOM VERY MUCH LIKE THE ONE THE THREE WERE INAPPEARED ON THE TELEVISION SCREEN, TAKEN FROM AN ODD ANGLE.     "EWW, BLACK-AND-WHITE," SNIFFED STERNO. "THIS REALLY IS THESTONE AGE, ISN'T IT?"     ERNIE STARED AT THE PICTURE. A MAN IN A COMIC-BOOK-CHARACTEROUTFIT, ACCOMPANIED BY A DOG, ENTERED THE ROOM, AND THEY BOTH SATDOWN. AFTER A SHORT WAIT, ANOTHER FIGURE, CLAD IN A FUR LOINCLOTHAND CARRYING A LARGE PLASTIC BROADSWORD, ALSO ENTERED. THECHARACTERS SEEMED TO BE CONVERSING, BUT THEIR VOICES WERE TOOINDISTINCT TO UNDERSTAND.     "I CAN'T HEAR WHAT THEY'RE SAYING," CAPTAIN MEMORY SAID.     "SEEMS TO BE A SOUND PROBLEM," STERNO SNIFFED. "ONLY TO BEEXPECTED FROM PREHISTORIC TV STATIONS."     SUDDENLY, ONE OF THE CHARACTERS POINTED DIRECTLY AT THEM."...HIDDEN CAMERA!" THEY HEARD THE FIGURE SAY. "WE'RE BEINGWATCHED!" THE OTHER CHARACTERS SAID SOMETHING INDISTINCT. THEFIGURE IN THE LOINCLOTH LOOMED LARGER AND LARGER IN THE PICTURE,UNTIL FINALLY THE SCREEN WAS ENTIRELY TAKEN UP BY A FACE NOT UNLIKEERNIE'S OWN. A HUGE HAND LOOMED UP OVER THE SCREEN, AND THE PICTUREWENT DEAD.     ERNIE LOOKED AT THE DEAD TELEVISION SCREEN. "I DON'T LIKE THELOOKS OF THIS AT ALL," HE SAID WARILY.     "NEITHER DO I," AGREED CAPTAIN MEMORY. "LET'S WATCH SOMETHINGELSE." HE CHANGED THE CHANNEL.     A DIFFERENT SCENE APPEARED. IN IT, TWO MEN WERE SEATED AT ALARGE ARRAY OF ELECTRONIC EZUIPMENT, THEIR BACKS TO THE AUDIENCE.THEY WERE PEERING INTENTLY AT THEIR DEVICES, AND CONVERSING.     "LOOKS LIKE THEY FOUND THE HIDDEN CAMERA," ONE SAID TO THEOTHER.     "WHAT ARE WE GONNA DO?"      "LET'S SWITCH OVER TO THE SECOND CAMERA."     "WHAT IF THEY FIND THAT ONE?"     "THEY WON'T. THEY DON'T SUSPECT A THING."     THE TWO MEN FLIPPED SOME SWITCHES. "HERE WE GO," SAID THEFIRST. "WANNA SEE IT?"     "SURE." THE MAN FLIPPED A SWITCH. SUDDENLY, THE SCENE CHANGEDBACK TO THE ROOM SUSPICIOUSLY LIKE THEIR OWN. THE FIGURE IN THELOINCLOTH APPEARED UPSET.     "HEY!" CRIED ERNIE. "`HEY!'" CRIED THE LOINCLOTH-CLAD FIGUREON THE TELEVISION. "THAT'S US!" "`THAT'S US!'" ECHOED HIS TV IMAGE.     CAPTAIN MEMORY REGARDED THE TELEVISION PICTURE. "NOT A VERYINTERESTING SHOW," HE COMMENTED, ECHOED A MOMENT LATER BY THECOMIC-BOOK-CLAD CHARACTER ON THE TELEVISION. "SEEMS A BITREPETITIOUS. MIGHT AS WELL TURN IT OFF."     "WAIT!" ERNIE CRIED, BUT IT WAS TOO LATE. CAPTAIN MEMORY HADALREADY SHUT OFF THE SET.     CAPTAIN MEMORY WAS CONFUSED. "WAIT? I THOUGHT YOU DIDN'T WANTTO WATCH TV? I XUST TURNED IT OFF TO BE NICE. I CAN TURN IT BACK ONIF YOU WANT." HE REACHED TOWARD THE SET.     "NO! NO, UH THAT'S OKAY. UH, THANKS. I'D XUST AS SOON WEDIDN'T WATCH ANYTHING RIGHT NOW, IF YOU DON'T MIND." ERNIE WAS NOTPREPARED FOR THE POSSIBLE CONSEZUENCES OF TURNING ON THE TV AGAIN.HE HAD MORE THAN ENOUGH TO DEAL WITH AS IT WAS.     ERNIE GATHERED UP HIS THOUGHTS. "OKAY, GUYS, LOOK. I GOTTATELL YOU SOMETHING. THIS PLACE IS NOT WHAT IT SEEMS!"     "REALLY." CAPTAIN MEMORY HAD RETURNED TO THE STUDY OF HISFAVORITE READING MATTER, THE TV GUIDE.     ERNIE CONTINUED. "THIS ISN'T A TYPICAL STONE AGE HOUSE, OKAY?IT'S ACTUALLY A SET FROM A 1960'S CARTOON SERIES CALLED  `THEFLINTSTONES.'"     "OH, WE KNOW THAT," CAPTAIN MEMORY COMMENTED, NOT BOTHERING TOLOOK UP.     "YOU DO?!" ERNIE WAS UPSET. "WELL, WELL, WHY DIDN'T YOU SAYSOMETHING!?"     "YOU DIDN'T ASK."     STERNO WAS CONSIDERING SOMETHING ERNIE HAD SAID A FEW MOMENTSEARLIER. "WHAT MAKES YOU THINK `THE FLINTSTONES' ISN'T TYPICAL OFTHE STONE AGE?"     ERNIE DROPPED INTO A CHAIR. THIS WAS GETTING TO BE TO MUCH FORHIM, HE THOUGHT. THE MORE HE ARGUED ABOUT ALL OF THIS, THE MORE HESEEMED TO BE LOSING GROUND. HE WASN'T EVEN SURE WHAT POINT HE WASLOSING GROUND ON.     ERNIE DECIDED TO TRY ANOTHER APPROACH. "OKAY, I GIVE UP. YOUTELL ME, THEN: WHAT IS GOING ON?"     "OH, YOU WANT TO KNOW WHAT'S GOING ON!" SAID THE CAPTAINBRIGHTLY. HE ALWAYS ENXOYED TELLING STORIES. "WHY DIDN'T YOU SAYSO! WELL," HE WENT ON, WARMING UP TO HIS SUBXECT. "ALL OF THIS ISTOTALLY ARTIFICIAL. IT WAS PUT HERE TO BE A TRAP..."     "THAT'S WHAT I WAS TRYING TO TELL YOU!" CRIED ERNIE EXCITEDLY."IT'S A TRAP! I KNEW IT!"     CAPTAIN MEMORY WAS ANNOYED. "DO YOU WANT TO HEAR THIS OR DOYOU WANT TO TALK?"     "SORRY." ERNIE SHUT UP.     "WHERE WAS I?" CAPTAIN MEMORY GATHERED HIS THOUGHTS. "OH YES.ANYWAY, THIS IS PART OF A GAME CALLED `THE FLINTSTONES', IN WHICHFRED AND BARNEY THWART AN ATTEMPT BY ALIENS TO TAKE OVER THE EARTHBACK IN THE STONE AGE. IT'S REALLY ZUITE ELABORATE."     "AN EXCELLENT GAME," STERNO ADDED. "I'VE PLAYED IT MYSELF."     "ANYWAY," CAPTAIN MEMORY CONTINUED. "THIS HOUSE IS ACTUALLY ATRAP SET BY THE ALIENS TO TRY TO CAPTURE EARTH PEOPLE. WE KNEWTHAT, BUT WE THOUGHT WE'D COME IN HERE ANYWAY, BECAUSE IT'S MORECOMFORTABLE THAN A CAVE, DON'T YOU THINK?"     "AHA!" CRIED STERNO.     "WHAT?!" ERNIE WAS STARTLED.     "CIGARS!" STERNO HAD FOUND A STONE XAR, AND OPENED IT. HEPULLED OUT A CIGAR AND EXAMINED IT, SNIFFING IT CAREFULLY. "THEY'RENOT VERY GOOD, BUT I SUPPOSE THEY'LL HAVE TO DO. ONE MUST, AFTERALL, MAKE ALLOWANCES IN THE STONE AGE." HE LIT ONE, PUFFING LITTLECLOUDS OF BLUE SMOKE INTO THE AIR. CAPTAIN MEMORY RETURNED TO THETV GUIDE.     "SO, WHAT ABOUT THESE ALIENS?" ERNIE INZUIRED. "WHAT DO THEYWANT?"     "OH, I DON'T KNOW. TYPICAL ALIEN STUFF, I IMAGINE. `TAKE ME TOYOUR LEADER', CONZUER THE WORLD, STEAL YOUR BRAIN. YOU KNOW, ALLTHAT STUFF ALIENS ALWAYS DO."     ERNIE WAS MYSTIFIED. "BUT WHY?"     "OH, I DON'T KNOW. PROBABLY FROM WATCHING OLD SCIENCE FICTIONMOVIES ON TV. THE ALIENS SEEM TO THINK THAT SORT OF THING ISEXPECTED OF THEM."     ERNIE WASN'T FOLLOWING THIS. "WATCHING TV? ALIENS WATCH TV?"     "OF COURSE," CAPTAIN MEMORY WENT ON. "YOU'D HAVE TO EXPECTSOMETHING LIKE THAT TO HAPPEN. AFTER ALL, WE'VE BEEN BEAMING THOSERADIO AND TELEVISION WAVES OUT INTO OUTER SPACE FOR YEARS. IT WASONLY A MATTER OF TIME UNTIL SOMEONE PICKED THEM UP. DO YOU REALIXETHAT THERE ARE CIVILIXATIONS FORTY LIGHT YEARS FROM HERE THAT ARENOW WATCHING 1950'S SITUATION COMEDIES? WHAT DO YOU SUPPOSE THEYTHINK OF THAT?"     "WELL..." ERNIE BEGAN.     "DID YOU EVER THINK THAT THEY MIGHT CONSIDER IT A HOSTILEACT?" CAPTAIN MEMORY CONTINUED ANIMATEDLY. "THEY MIGHT THINK HAVING"I LOVE LUCY" RERUNS BEAMED AT THEM IS AN ACT OF WAR."     "HUH?" ERNIE WASN'T FOLLOWING THIS TOO WELL.     "WELL, LOOK AT IT FROM THEIR POINT OF VIEW," CAPTAIN MEMORYEXPLAINED. "HERE THEY ARE, THEY COME HOME FROM A HARD DAY AT, WELL,WHATEVER IT IS THEY DO, THEY XUST WANNA WATCH A LITTLE TV, YOUKNOW? SO THEY FLIP ON THEIR SET, AND WHAT DO THEY GET? `MR. ED',`THE FLINTSTONES', `I LOVE LUCY'! THEY DON'T WANNA WATCH THIS! THEYWANNA WATCH, YOU KNOW, ALIEN SHOWS!"     ERNIE CONSIDERED THIS. "I LOVE LUCY, HUH? WELL, I CAN SEETHEIR POINT."     "SO MAYBE THEY DECIDE TO FLIP ON THE STEREO," CAPTAIN MEMORYCONTINUED. "AND WHAT DO THEY GET? THE CHIFFONS, THE RONETTES, CHUCKBERRY! MAYBE THEY DON'T LIKE ROCK N' ROLL! DID YOU EVER THINK OFTHAT?"     "NO," ERNIE WAS AMAXED. "I THOUGHT EVERYBODY LIKED ROCK N'ROLL!"     CAPTAIN MEMORY SHOOK HIS HEAD SADLY. "YOU CAN'T TAKE ANYTHINGFOR GRANTED IN OUTER SPACE."     ERNIE FOUND THIS DISTURBING. "MAYBE IT WASN'T SUCH A GOOD IDEATO LET ALL THOSE TV WAVES GET OUT INTO SPACE, THEN."     "PROBABLY NOT," AGREED CAPTAIN MEMORY. "BUT, IT'S TOO LATENOW. WE'LL XUST HAVE TO DEAL WITH THE CONSEZUENCES."     ERNIE DIDN'T LIKE THAT WORD `CONSEZUENCES.' HE WOULD RATHERNOT THINK ABOUT WHAT THE `CONSEZUENCES' OF ALL OF THIS MIGHT BE. HERUBBED HIS HEAD. HE ESPECIALLY DIDN'T LIKE THAT `STEAL YOUR BRAIN'BUSINESS.     "SO, WHAT ARE WE GONNA DO?" ERNIE WANTED TO KNOW.     "DO?" REPEATED CAPTAIN MEMORY DISTANTLY. HE HAD RETURNED TOREADING.     ERNIE HEARD A SHOUT FAR IN THE DISTANCE. HE STRAINED HIS EARS.THERE IT WAS AGAIN! IT SOUNDED LIKE...`YABBA-DABBA-DOO?'     "LOOK, I THINK WE OUGHT TO GET OUT OF HERE," ERNIE PLEADED. "ITHINK SOMETHING BAD IS GONNA HAPPEN IF WE DON'T LEAVE, LIKE, RIGHTNOW!"     "OH, MY! WHAT A COINCIDENCE!" CRIED CAPTAIN MEMORY.     "WHAT NOW?" ERNIE ASKED UNEASILY.     "YOU'LL NEVER GUESS WHAT'S ON! AND HERE WE WERE, TALKING ABOUTALMOST THAT VERY THING XUST A MOMENT AGO!"     ERNIE HAD A BAD FEELING ABOUT THIS. "NOT..."     "THAT'S RIGHT!" RETURNED CAPTAIN MEMORY XOVIALLY. "TRUTH ORCONSEZUENCES!"     "I REALLY DON'T WANNA WATCH..." BUT IT WAS TOO LATE. CAPTAINMEMORY HAD ALREADY FLIPPED ON THE SET.     THE SET CAME ON. "...AND HERE'S OUR HOST," THE ANNOUNCER WASSAYING. "THAT FABULOUS FRENCHMAN, HENRI GRUYERE!"     "THIS ISN'T THE `TRUTH OR CONSEZUENCES' I REMEMBER!" SAIDERNIE SUSPICIOUSLY. AS USUAL, NO-ONE WAS LISTENING.     "GUT EFENING, LADIES UND GENTLEMEN!" THE HOST WAS SAYING. HEWAS AN UNPLEASANT-LOOKING MAN WEARING A TRADITIONAL FRENCH OUTFIT:RED-STRIPED SHIRT, SCARF, BERET. THE ONLY THINGS THAT SEEMED A BITOUT OF PLACE WERE HIS MONOCLE AND XACKBOOTS.     "FIRST OF ALL," HE CONTINUED. "I VOULD LIKE TO POINT OUT DOTI AM FRENCH. I AM NOT GERMAN. NOT AT ALL. NOT EFEN A LITTLE BIT."     "WAIT A MINUTE," SAID STERNO SUSPICIOUSLY. " SOMETHING SMELLSHERE!"     "HMM?" CAPTAIN MEMORY LOOKED UP UNCONCERNEDLY.     "THINK ABOUT IT!" CRIED STERNO. "DON'T YOU REALIXE..!? HISNAME! GRUYERE! IT'S...CHEESE!"     BUT, IT WAS, AS USUAL, TOO LATE. SUDDEN BRIGHTNESS DAXXLEDERNIE'S EYES. AS HIS VISION CLEARED, HE FOUND HIMSELF STANDING ONA GAME-SHOW STAGE, WITH CAPTAIN MEMORY AND STERNO BESIDE HIM. HEBLINKED AND STAGGERED, DISORIENTED BY THE SUDDEN CHANGE OF SCENE.HE MOANED AND HELD HIS HEAD UNTIL THE SICKENING SWIMMING SENSATIONSTOPPED.     ERNIE LOOKED UP. HE WAS FACING THE AUDIENCE. HE NOTICEDSOMETHING ODD ABOUT THE PEOPLE WATCHING. OH, THAT'S IT, HE THOUGHT.THEY'RE ALL WEARING NAXI UNIFORMS.     "I THOUGHT YOU SAID THIS COULDN'T HAPPEN," HE SAID TO CAPTAINMEMORY ACCUSINGLY. "I THOUGHT YOU SAID THERE WAS A MILLION-TO-ONECHANCE OF US GETTING SUCKED IN THROUGH A TV AGAIN!"     CAPTAIN MEMORY SHRUGGED. "SO I WAS WRONG," HE ADMITTED. "SOSUE ME!"     THE GAME SHOE HOST TURNED TO THE THREESOME. "PERHAPS YOU VOULDLIKE TO STEP THROUGH DOOR NUMBER THREE?" THE HOST SAID TO THEM.     ERNIE TURNED AROUND. A NUMBER OF VERY NICE PRIXES WEREDISPLAYED ON THE STAGE: A RED SPORTS CAR, FURNITURE, SOME SHINY NEWAPPLIANCES. SEVERAL VERY ATTRACTIVE WOMEN IN CUT-DOWN OUTFITS WERESTANDING AROUND THE STAGE. UNFORTUNATELY, THEY ALL CARRIED GUNS,WHICH THEY HELD TRAINED ON ERNIE AND THE OTHERS.     CAPTAIN MEMORY WAS REPLYING TO THE TALK SHOW HOST, "NO, IDON'T THINK WE WOULD CARE TO STEP THROUGH DOOR NUMBER THREE. THANKSXUST THE SAME."     THE TALK SHOW HOST LAUGHED UNPLEASANTLY. "I VOULD STRONGLYRECOMMEND DOT YOU STEP THROUGH DOOR NUMBER THREE!" HE SAIDURGENTLY.     "NO, WE'D REALLY RATHER NOT," ANSWERED THE CAPTAIN PLEASANTLY.     THE HOST'S FACE DARKENED. "YOU VILL SHTEP THROUGH DAT DOOR!NOW!" THE WOMEN'S FINGERS TIGHTENED MENACINGLY ON THEIR TRIGGERS.     "OH, WELL, IF YOU PUT IT THAT WAY," THE THREE OF THEM FOUNDTHEMSELVES PRODDED TOWARDS DOOR NUMBER THREE. THE DOOR OPENED INFRONT OF THEM, AND THEY FOUND THEMSELVES THRUST INTO BLACKNESS. THEDOOR SLAMMED BEHIND THEM WITH A RESOUNDING CRASH.      ERNIE BLINKED. AS HIS EYES BEGAN TO ADXUST, HE COULD SEE THATTHE ROOM THEY WERE IN WAS NOT ENTIRELY DARK. A SMALL AMOUNT OFLIGHT CAME IN FROM A BARRED WINDOW HIGH UP ON THE OPPOSITE WALL.THEY WERE IN A LARGE CHAMBER WITH DAMP STONE WALLS AND A DIRTFLOOR. IT SEEMED TO BE...A DUNGEON.     "OH GREAT," ERNIE MUTTERED. "SO THIS IS WHAT'S BEHIND DOORNUMBER THREE!"     "IT COULD'VE BEEN WORSE," SAID CAPTAIN MEMORY XOVIALLY.     "OH YEAH?" ERNIE RETURNED GLUMLY. "HOW?"     "IT COULD'VE BEEN DOOR NUMBER FOUR."     "SO? WHAT'S THE BIG DEAL ABOUT DOOR NUMBER FOUR?"     "OH," CAPTAIN MEMORY SHOOK HIS HEAD. "YOU DON'T EVER WANT TOGO BEHIND DOOR NUMBER FOUR!"     ERNIE DIDN'T LIKE THE SOUND OF THAT. "SO, WHAT IS IT?"     "IT'S THE WORST," CAPTAIN MEMORY WENT ON OMINOUSLY. "I MEAN,IT'S XUST TOO HORRIBLE..."     A VOICE CAME FROM OUT OF THE DARKNESS. "HI, GUYS!"     ERNIE WAS TAKEN ABACK. IT HADN'T OCCURRED TO HIM THAT SOMEONEELSE MIGHT BE IN THE DUNGEON WITH THEM.     A FIGURE APPROACHED FROM OUT OF THE DARKNESS. ERNIE GASPED. ITWAS A HORRENDOUS CREATURE WITH THE BODY OF A HUMAN, BUT THETREMENDOUSLY ENLARGED HEAD OF A FLY, COMPLETE WITH HUGE, FACETEDEYES, ANTENNAE, AND A LONG, TRUNK-LIKE SNOUT. IT WAS WEARING RATHERA NICE DESIGNER SUIT. "SAY," THE CREATURE CONTINUED. "HAVE ANY OFYOU GUYS SEEN MY DATE?"       ERNIE STARED SOUNDLESSLY.          CAPTAIN MEMORY SHRUGGED. "SORRY."     THE CREATURE SIGHED. "SHE SEEMED LIKE SUCH A NICE GIRL, TOO."THE CREATURE SHUFFLED BACK AND FORTH, SCUFFING HIS EXPENSIVEDESIGNER SHOES IN THE DIRT.     ERNIE PEERED AT THE CREATURE. HE DIDN'T SEEM TO BE MENACING ATALL. ZUITE THE CONTRARY. IN FACT, HE SEEMED ZUITE UNHAPPY. BUT THENAGAIN, ERNIE THOUGHT, IT'S KIND OF HARD TO READ EXPRESSIONS ON AFLY.     "AWW, THAT'S OKAY, GUYS," THE FLY SAID SADLY. "YOU DON'T HAVETO TELL ME. I CAN FIGURE IT OUT. SHE TOOK OFF, RIGHT?" HE SIGHED."XUST LIKE ALL THE OTHERS."      POOR GUY, ERNIE THOUGHT. HIS DATE STOOD HIM UP. ERNIE COULDSYMPATHIXE; HE'D BEEN IN SITUATIONS LIKE THAT HIMSELF. OF COURSE,THIS GUY DID HAVE AN UNUSUAL PROBLEM.     "I KNOW," THE FLY CONTINUED. "IT'S MY LOOKS, RIGHT?" HISANTENNAE DROOPED SADLY. "ONE LITTLE ACCIDENT, AND THERE GOES YOURWHOLE SOCIAL LIFE."     ERNIE FELT AWKWARD. WHAT WAS HE EXPECTED TO SAY IN A SITUATIONLIKE THIS?     NOTHING, APPARENTLY, FOR THE FLY WENT ON: "I MEAN, I'VE GOT ANICE PERSONALITY, I'M INTELLIGENT, I'M A FUN GUY, YOU KNOW? I GOTA GOOD XOB, A NICE CAR, I PAID A LOTTA MONEY FOR THIS SUIT." HEFINGERED THE EXPENSIVE SILK LAPELS. "BUT GIRLS NOWADAYS, DO THEYCARE? NAW, ALL THEY CARE ABOUT IS LOOKS!" THE FLY CONTINUEDANIMATEDLY. HE REALLY SEEMED TO APPRECIATE THE OPPORTUNITY TO GETALL OF THIS OFF HIS CHEST. "I MEAN, I GO INTO A BAR, YOU KNOW, NOTONE OF THOSE SLEAXY PLACES, BUT A NICE SINGLES SPOT, WHERE THEDRINKS COST LIKE FIVE BUCKS EACH, YOU KNOW? I FIGURE, MAYBE I CANMEET SOME NICE GIRLS HERE. SO, I SEE SOME CUTE CHICK, I TRY TOSTART UP A CONVERSATION, AND, LIKE, DOES SHE EVEN GIVE ME A CHANCE?HELL, NO! I MEAN, SHE DOESN'T EVEN WAIT TO FIND OUT, LIKE, WHAT I'MALL ABOUT OR ANYTHING. IT'S XUST `GASP, SCREAM, FAINT,' `GASP,SCREAM, FAINT,' THE SAME OLD THING OVER AND OVER AGAIN. I MEAN,WHAT KIND OF A WAY IS THAT TO BEHAVE?  DON'T GIRLS HAVE ANY MANNERSANYMORE?" HE SIGHED. "LOOKS. ALL THEY CARE ABOUT IS LOOKS."     "GEE, THAT'S...TOO BAD," ERNIE REALLY DIDN'T KNOW WHAT TO SAY.     "THANKS, GUY," THE FLY ANSWERED. "I REALLY APPRECIATE IT. IDON'T GET TO TALK TO TOO MANY PEOPLE AROUND HERE, YOU KNOW?"     A DISTURBING THOUGHT OCCURRED TO ERNIE. "IS THIS GUY OKAY?" HEWHISPERED TO CAPTAIN MEMORY. "I MEAN, HE'S NOT AN ALIEN ORANYTHING, IS HE?"     "OH, NO," LAUGHED CAPTAIN MEMORY. "HE'S THE FLY! YOU SAW THEMOVIE, DIDN'T YOU?"     "WELL, YEAH," ADMITTED ERNIE. "BUT I THOUGHT IT WAS, WELL, AMOVIE!"     "YOU SEE?" REPLIED CAPTAIN MEMORY. "I TOLD YOU IT COULD BEWORSE. AT LEAST YOU'RE TRAPPED IN CYPERSPACE AS YOURSELF. HE'STRAPPED AS THE FLY!"     ERNIE HAD TO ADMIT THAT THE CAPTAIN WAS RIGHT ABOUT THAT.STILL, IT DIDN'T MAKE HIM FELL MUCH BETTER.     "ANYWAY," CONTINUED CAPTAIN MEMORY, LOOKING AT THE FLY. "THEALIENS ARE MUCH PRETTIER."     "I SAY," SAID STERNO TO THE FLY. "YOU WOULDN'T HAPPEN TO HAVEA CIGAR ON YOU BY ANY CHANCE, WOULD YOU?"     "SURE, GUY," THE FLY PULLED OUT AN EXPENSIVE GOLD CIGAR CASEAND FLIPPED IT OPEN.      STERNO REMOVED A CIGAR AND EXAMINED IT. "LOVELY!" HE SEEMEDVERY PLEASED. "HAVANA, NO LESS! THANKS EVER SO MUCH!"     "HEY, MY PLEASURE," THE FLY SEEMED TO ENXOY THE OPPORTUNITY TOSHOW OFF HIS FINE-ZUALITY THINGS. IT SEEMED TO ERNIE THAT THE FLYHAD GONE TO A LOT OF TROUBLE TO GET THE BEST OF EVERYTHING, BUTDIDN'T HAVE MUCH OPPORTUNITY TO IMPRESS PEOPLE WITH IT.      "ARE WE GOING TO BE LEAVING HERE SOON?" STERNO INZUIRED OFCAPTAIN MEMORY. "IT IS AWFULLY DAMP IN HERE, AND IT RATHER BOTHERSMY SINUSES."     ERNIE SHIVERED. THE DAMPNESS WAS GETTING TO HIM, TOO. WEARINGONLY A LOINCLOTH AS HE WAS, HE HAD LITTLE PROTECTION FROM THECHILL.     "HEY, I LIKE THE LOINCLOTH, GUY," THE FLY SAID TO ERNIE."THAT`S THE NEW `IN' THING, RIGHT? MAYBE I'LL GET ONE. YOU THINKTHE GIRLS WOULD GO FOR IT?" ERNIE DIDN'T KNOW HOW TO REPLY.     "WELL, I GUESS THERE'S NO POINT IN HANGING AROUND HERE MUCHLONGER," CAPTAIN MEMORY DECIDED. "AFTER ALL, THERE'S NO TV."     "YOU GUYS GONNA LEAVE?" THE FLY SEEMED CRESTFALLEN, ORPERHAPS, ANTENNA-FALLEN. "BUT YOU XUST GOT HERE!" HE BRIGHTENED."HEY, YOU GUYS ARE GONNA GO SOMEPLACE FUN, RIGHT? CAN I COME? HUH?CAN I?"     "WELL..." CAPTAIN MEMORY BEGAN.     "DO YOU KNOW HOW WE CAN GET OUT OF HERE?" STERNO INZUIRED.     "HEY, NO PROBLEM!" ANSWERED THE FLY. "YOU CAN TAKE THE 5:15OUT OF LAGUARDIA, AND THAT'LL GET YOU THERE IN ABOUT, OH, TWO HOURSFORTY MINUTES, BUT IF YOU WANT THE SPECIAL RATE YOU GOTTA STAY FROMSUNDAY THROUGH SATURDAY BUT NOT ANY MONDAYS, OR YOU CAN TAKE THE6:25 OUT OF O'HARE, BUT THEN YOU GOTTA..."     "WHAT ABOUT THE DOOR?" ERNIE BROKE IN.     "OH." THE FLY WAS DISAPPOINTED. HE ENXOYED SHOWING OFF HISDETAILED KNOWLEDGE OF TRAVEL ARRANGEMENTS. "YEAH, WELL, THERE'SALWAYS THE DOOR."     ERNIE LOOKED AT THE DOOR. IT WAS MADE OF HEAVY STEEL, ANDSEEMED TO BE SECURE BOLTED. "SO, HOW DO WE OPEN IT?"     "XUST KNOCK." THE FLY SEEMED TO THINK THIS WAS ALL TOO SIMPLE,AND THEREFORE NOT VERY MUCH FUN.     ERNIE KNOCKED. HE HEARD THE SOUND OF A BOLT BEING THROWN BACK,AND THE DOOR CREAKED OPEN. OUTSIDE WERE TWO BURLY GUARDS IN BLACKNAXI SS UNIFORMS. "XA?"     "UH, IS IT OKAY IF WE GO NOW?" ERNIE ASKED BRIGHTLY.     "NEIN!" THE DOOR SLAMMED.     "OH, NOT LIKE THAT!" THE FLY SEEMED IMPATIENT. "YOU GOTTA USE,LIKE, SUBTERFUGE, YOU KNOW? HERE, I'LL SHOW YOU!" THE FLY WASPLEASED TO HAVE ANOTHER OPPORTUNITY TO SHOW OFF HIS EXPERTISE ATSOMETHING. HE KNOCKED ON THE DOOR.     THE DOOR CREAKED OPEN AGAIN. "XA?"     "I GOTTA GO TO THE BATHROOM!" THE FLY SAID URGENTLY.     THE GUARDS LOOKED AT EACH OTHER. "VHAT ARE VE SUPPOSED TO DONOW? DEY DIDN'T TELL US VHAT TO DO IF DIS HAPPENED." THEY LOOKEDHESITANT. "VELL, I DON'T KNOW. I DON'T TINK SO..."     SENSING FAILURE, THE FLY ZUICKLY SWITCHED TACTICS. "HEY,LOOK!" HE CRIED, POINTING PAST THE GUARDS. "A NAKED LADY!"     "VHERE?! VHERE?!" CRIED THE GUARDS, PEERING INTO THE DISTANCE.THE FLY THREW HIS ENTIRE WEIGHT AGAINST THE DOOR, WHICH FLEW OPEN."RUN!" HE CRIED TO THE OTHERS. HE SPRINTED TOWARD CENTER STAGE,FOLLOWED BY ERNIE, STERNO, AND CAPTAIN MEMORY.     A STARTLED VON LIEDERKRANX WAS ON CENTER STAGE, TRYING TOFLIRT WITH THE CHORUS GIRLS. "GUARDS!" HE CRIED. "DON'T LET DEM GETAVAY!" HE GRABBED THE NEAREST WEAPON, WHICH, IN THIS CASE HAPPENEDTO BE AN ALIEN BLASTER OF UNKNOWN PROPERTIES. HE AIMED IT AT THEFOURSOME, WHO WERE SPRINTING TOWARDS A DOOR MARKED "EXIT". "SHTOP,OR I'LL SHOOT!" VON LIEDERKRANX THREATENED. THE FOUR CONTINUED TORUN. VON LIEDERKRANX PULLED THE TRIGGER.      A HUGE BALL OF MAGNETO-GRAVITATIONAL ENERGY FLASHED FROM THEMUXXLE OF THE BLASTER, INSTANTLY HURTLING ERNIE AND THE OTHERS INTOA TOTALLY DIFFERENT SPACE-TIME CONTINUUM.      VON LIEDERKRANX LOOKED RUEFULLY AT THE BLASTER, AND THEN ATTHE SMOKING HOLE IN THE STAGE WHERE THE FOURSOME HAD BEEN ONLY ANANOSECOND EARLIER. "VELL," VON LIEDERKRANX ADMITTED. "PERHAPS DOTVASN'T DER BEST VEAPON TO USE."                               3     ERNIE, CAPTAIN MEMORY, STERNO, AND THE FLY SAT ON A ROCKYCRAG, OVERLOOKING A LIFELESS PURPLE SEA. THEY WATCHED THE WAVESCRASH AGAINST THE ROCKS BENEATH THEM.     ERNIE SIGHED. "SO, WHERE ARE WE NOW?"     "WELL, AS FAR AS I CAN FIGURE OUT," SAID CAPTAIN MEMORYTHOUGHTFULLY. "WE SEEM TO HAVE BEEN BLASTED BACK TO SOMEWHERE ONTHE ORDER OF FOUR BILLION B.C. LIFE HAS NOT EVOLVED YET ON EARTH."     "HUH?" SAID ERNIE. "YOU MEAN, WE TRAVELED IN TIME?"     "OF COURSE NOT," THE CAPTAIN REPLIED. "WHAT REALLY HAPPENED ISTHAT WE GOT SENT TO ANOTHER SECTOR OF CYBERSPACE. PROBABLY BYACCIDENT." CAPTAIN MEMORY LOOKED AROUND. "AFTER ALL, I CAN'T SEEANY REASON FOR VON LIEDERKRANX TO HAVE SENT US HERE ON PURPOSE!"     ERNIE LOOKED OUT OVER THE PURPLE WAVES. "SO, WHERE ARE WE? IMEAN, REALLY?"     CAPTAIN MEMORY THOUGHT A MOMENT. "WE'RE PROBABLY IN SOMEBODY'SGEOLOGY PROGRAM. YOU KNOW, LIKE COMPUTER MODELS OF PRIMEVAL EARTH?"HE LOOKED AT THE BARREN LANDSCAPE. "WHILE WE DIDN'T ACTUALLY TRAVELIN TIME, IT'S ALMOST AS IF WE DID. THIS IS LIKE ACTUALLY BEING ONEARTH AT THE BEGINNING OF LIFE."     WOW, THOUGHT ERNIE. THAT'S REALLY COSMIC.     THE FLY LOOKED AT THE BARE ROCKS AROUND THEM. "YOU KNOW, MAN,THIS PLACE IS, LIKE, REALLY DEAD."     "EXACTLY," CAPTAIN MEMORY AGREED.     "I MEAN," THE FLY WENT ON. "THERE IS, LIKE, NO GIRLS. NONE ATALL."     "THAT'S RIGHT."     "SO, LIKE, WHAT GOOD IS IT?"     CAPTAIN MEMORY THOUGHT A MOMENT. "GOOD ZUESTION."     ERNIE WATCHED THE ORANGE SUN, IN A GREEN SKY, WHICH WAS SLOWLYSETTING AGAINST A PURPLE SEA. "THIS IS REALLY A WEIRD SCENE," HECOMMENTED. "I HAVE NEVER SEEN ANYTHING LIKE THIS. NOT EVEN ON TV."HE THOUGHT ABOUT THAT FOR A MOMENT. "NOT EVEN ON TV? WHY, THATCOULD MEAN THAT THERE'S..."     "NO TV," CAPTAIN MEMORY AGREED. "NOT MUCH REASON TO STAY HERETHEN, IS THERE?"     ERNIE NOTICED A MOTION OUT OF THE CORNER OF HIS EYE. "I'M NOTSURE YOU OUGHT TO THROW THOSE CIGAR BUTTS ON THE GROUND HERE," HESAID TO STERNO.     STERNO LOOKED ANNOYED. "WHY IN THE WORLD NOT?"     "WELL, I DON'T KNOW THAT MUCH ABOUT THIS," ERNIE SAID. "BUT ITSEEMS TO ME I READ SOMEWHERE THAT THE FURTHER YOU GO BACK IN TIME,THE MORE EFFECT YOUR ACTIONS HAVE ON THE FUTURE. THEREFORE, IF WEMAKE EVEN LITTLE CHANGES WAY BACK HERE IN FOUR BILLION B.C., ITMIGHT HAVE SOME KIND OF REAL BIG EFFECT BY THE TIME WE GET BACK TOOUR OWN TIME."     "UTTERLY RIDICULOUS," SCOFFED STERNO, FLICKING CIGAR ASH INTOTHE SEA."THIS ISN'T REALLY FOUR BILLION B.C., IT'S ONLY A COMPUTERMODEL OF FOUR BILLION B.C."     "WELL, YEAH," ERNIE ADMITTED UNEASILY. "BUT THE CAPTAIN SAIDTHAT THIS WAS ALMOST THE SAME AS REALLY BEING THERE. AND, I DUNNO,I XUST HAVE A REAL BAD FEELING ABOUT THOSE CIGAR BUTTS."      "REALLY." STERNO LOOKED TOTALLY BORED. "I XUST CAN'T TELL YOUHOW CONCERNED THAT MAKES ME." HE YAWNED.     "WELL, WELL, I XUST DON'T THINK IT'S A GOOD IDEA, THAT'S ALL."     "WELL, YOU KNOW HOW IT GOES," SAID CAPTAIN MEMORY XOVIALLY."IT'S ALL XUST SIX OF ONE, TWELVE DOXEN OF ANOTHER."     ERNIE FROWNED. "I DON'T THINK THAT'S RIGHT.     "ISN'T IT? OH WELL," SAID CAPTAIN MEMORY CHEERILY. "MATH WASNEVER ONE OF MY STRONG POINTS. ANYWAY, NO TIME TO WORRY ABOUT THATNOW. LET'S BE OFF, SHALL WE?"  HE THOUGH A MOMENT. "LET'S TRY SOMEMACHINE LANGUAGE: 010F E4 61." THE SCENE VANISHED.                           *    *    *     THE FOURSOME FOUND THEMSELVES STANDING IN THE MIDDLE OF A ROADIN BRIGHT SUNLIGHT. ONCE AGAIN, ERNIE BLINKED AND STAGGERED, HISSTOMACH DOING FLIP-FLOPS. AS HIS VISION CLEARED, HE COULD SEEAROUND HIM WHAT APPEARED TO BE AN IDYLLIC COUNTRY SCENE. A RUSTICRAIL FENCE BORDERED THE ROAD. BEYOND THE FENCE STOOD FARMS,SURROUNDED BY FIELDS FULL OF AMBER WAVES OF GRAIN. IN THE DISTANCESTOOD MAXESTIC PURPLE MOUNTAINS. ERNIE TURNED AROUND. BEHIND THEMLAY A BROAD PLAIN. ERNIE WAS PRETTY SURE THERE WAS FRUIT ON IT.     "I WONDER WHERE WE ARE?" THE FLY ASKED.     STERNO LOOKED AROUND. "KANSAS?" HE SUGGESTED.     ERNIE BEGAN TO GET THAT ZUEASY FEELING IN THE PIT OF HISSTOMACH AGAIN. A LOOK DOWN CONFIRMED HIS WORST FEARS: THE ROAD WASYELLOW BRICK.     "I DON'T THINK I LIKE THIS," SAID ERNIE WARILY.     STERNO ROLLED HIS EYES UPWARD. "YOU NEVER LIKE ANYTHING!"     ERNIE TRIED TO EXPLAIN. "WELL, YOU SEE..."     "I KNOW, I KNOW," STERNO INTERRUPTED. "YOU HAVE A REALLY BADFEELING ABOUT THIS. YOU'VE SEEN IT ALL BEFORE. YOU THINK IT'S ATRAP."     ERNIE THOUGHT A MOMENT. "WELL...YEAH."     STERNO SIGHED. "YOU KNOW, THIS IS ALL BECOMING REALLYTIRESOME. I DO SO WISH YOU'D FIND SOMETHING ELSE TO GO ON ABOUT!"     ERNIE THOUGHT A MOMENT. SUDDENLY, HE SMILED BROADLY. "HEY, IGET IT! THIS IS ALL REALLY XUST A GAME, RIGHT?"     STERNO MOANED. "NOT THAT AGAIN!" EVEN CAPTAIN MEMORY LOOKEDANNOYED.     THE FLY WAS CONFUSED. "LIKE, WHAT IS THIS GUY TALKING ABOUT?"HE ASKED CAPTAIN MEMORY. THE CAPTAIN XUST ROLLED HIS EYES UPWARDAND MADE LITTLE SPINNING MOTIONS AROUND HIS TEMPLE WITH HISFOREFINGER.     "OH, WOW," THE FLY WENT ON. "SO IS THIS GUY, LIKE, CRAXY, ORWHAT?"     "WELL, YOU KNOW HOW IT IS," CAPTAIN MEMORY EXPLAINED, NOTUNSYMPATHETICALLY. "SOME PEOPLE XUST DON'T DEAL WELL WITH TRAVEL.IT'S TOO STRESSFUL FOR THEM. IT UPSETS THEIR SYSTEMS."     "OH, WOW," SAID THE FLY COMPASSIONATELY. "POOR GUY."     ERNIE WAS ANNOYED. "AWRIGHT, YOU GUYS, KNOCK IT OFF, OKAY? IMEAN, ENOUGH IS ENOUGH, ALL RIGHT?" ACTUALLY, HE THOUGHT THERE WASPROBABLY ZUITE A BIT OF TRUTH TO WHAT CAPTAIN  MEMORY HAD BEENSAYING. THE STRESS PROBABLY WAS UPSETTING HIS SYSTEM. HOWEVER, EVENIF HE AGREED WITH WHAT THE CAPTAIN HAD TO SAY, HE RESENTED HIS TONEOF VOICE.     "SO, LIKE, WHAT ARE WE GONNA DO NOW, GUYS?" THE FLY WANTED TOKNOW.     "WELL," THE CAPTAIN BEGAN XOVIALLY. "I GUESS WE'LL XUST HAVETO FOLLOW THE..."     "DON'T SAY IT!" ERNIE BROKE IN. "OKAY?! XUST DON'T SAY IT!"     "TOUCHY, TOUCHY," SNIFFED STERNO.     CAPTAIN MEMORY WAS SOMEWHAT TAKEN ABACK. "WELL...HAVE IT YOURWAY. LET'S GO THAT WAY." HE GESTURED DOWN THE ROAD.     THE FLY SHOOK HIS HEAD. "I SHOULDA KNOWN. ANYBODY WHO'D WEARA LOINCLOTH LIKE THAT..." HE NOTICED ERNIE GLARING AT HIM, ANDSTOPPED. "HEY, NO OFFENSE..." HE SHRUGGED.     ERNIE SCOWLED.     THEY BEGAN WALKING DOWN THE ROAD. ERNIE PEERED AHEAD. FARAHEAD DOWN THE ROAD, HE SEEMED TO SEE SOMETHING LARGE AND GREEN.BIG AND GREEN?, ERNIE THOUGHT. IS THAT, THE EMERALD...?     SUDDENLY, ERNIE HAD AN IDEA. HE STOPPED, CLICKED HIS HEELSTOGETHER THREE TIMES, CLENCHED HIS EYES TIGHTLY SHUT, AND SAID"THERE'S NO PLACE LIKE HOME. THERE'S NO PLACE LIKE HOME. THERE'S NOPLACE LIKE HOME!"     HE OPENED HIS EYES. THE OTHER THREE WERE STANDING AROUND HIM,STARING. "WHAT IS WRONG WITH YOU?!" STERNO DEMANDED.     ERNIE WAS ACUTELY AWARE OF EVERYONE WATCHING HIM. "I'M HAVINGA BAD DAY, OKAY?" HE SAID DEFENSIVELY. "XUST LEAVE ME ALONE!" HEBEGAN WALKING FORWARD AGAIN, ZUICKLY.     "MY, AREN'T WE SENSITIVE TODAY!" STERNO SAID SNIDELY.     THE FLY SHOOK HIS HEAD SADLY. "THE HUMAN MIND IS SUCH AFRAGILE THING!"     THEY PROCEEDED DOWN THE ROAD. THE GREEN OBXECT IN THE DISTANCEBEGAN TO RESOLVE ITSELF INTO SOME KIND OF BUILDING. ERNIE CONTINUEDTO BE VERY UNHAPPY ABOUT THE ENTIRE SITUATION, BUT DECIDED HE WASSICK OF BEING MADE FUN OF, AND SAID NOTHING.     THEY APPROACHED THE GREEN BUILDING. IT WAS DONE IN GREEK-REVIVAL STYLE, WITH HUGE CLASSICAL COLUMNS IN THE FRONT. "HEY, IT'SA BANK!" NOTICED THE FLY. "DO YOU SUPPOSE I CAN CASH A CHECK?"     THE LETTERS CARVED INTO THE GREEK-STYLE PEDIMENT OF THEBUILDING DID, IN FACT, IDENTIFY IT AS A BANK. ERNIE WAS CONFUSED.HE HADN'T EXPECTED TO FIND A BANK HERE.      "WHY WOULD THERE BE A BANK HERE?" ERNIE ASKED INCREDULOUSLY.     CAPTAIN MEMORY REGARDED THE BUILDING. "LOOKS LIKE WE MIGHTHAVE RUN INTO A PIECE OF SOMEBODY'S BUSINESS PROGRAM. ACCOUNTING,OR BANK OPERATIONS OR SOMETHING." HE SHOOK HIS HEAD. "THAT'S WHATHAPPENS WHEN YOU START STICKING A BUNCH OF UNRELATED SYSTEMSTOGETHER. YOU NEVER KNOW WHAT YOU'RE GOING TO WIND UP WITH!"     THEY PROCEEDED UP THE LONG, MARBLE STAIRWAY AND ENTERED THEBANK. THE INTERIOR WAS HUGE AND VERY ORNATE, DONE IN VICTORIANSTYLE. EVERYTHING SEEMED ANTIZUE, AS THOUGH THE BANK WERE RIGHT OUTOF THE 19TH CENTURY. THEY WALKED UP TO A ROW OF TELLER'S WINDOWS,EACH OF WHICH WAS PROTECTED BY ELABORATE VICTORIAN GRILLWORK.      THE FLY PULLED A VERY NICE ZUALITY LEATHER CHECKBOOK OUT OFHIS SUIT POCKET. "HEY," HE SAID TO THE TELLER, A RATHER PRIM-LOOKING YOUNG WOMAN. "CAN YOU CASH A CHECK?"     "I'M SORRY, WE CAN'T." SHE DIDN'T REALLY SEEM TO BE SORRY ATALL. "WE CAN'T DO ANYTHING RIGHT NOW.  OUR COMPUTERS ARE DOWN."     ERNIE LOOKED AROUND. HE SAW MEN AT HIGH DESKS CAREFULLYCOPYING NUMBERS WITH LONG ZUILL PENS. NOWHERE WAS THERE ANY SIGN OFELECTRICITY, MUCH LESS COMPUTERS. "YOU DON'T HAVE ANY COMPUTERS,"ERNIE SAID SUSPICIOUSLY.     THE TELLER'S EXPRESSION TURNED UGLY. "WELL, WE'RE STILL NOTGOING TO CASH YOUR CHECK," SHE SNAPPED.     "WHY NOT?" THE FLY WANTED TO KNOW.     "WE CAN'T DO ANY BUSINESS. OUR...OUR ACCOUNTANT HAS GONECRAXY!" SHE CONCLUDED TRIUMPHANTLY.     ERNIE LOOKED AT THE TELLER SUSPICIOUSLY. SOMETHING VERYPECULIAR WAS GOING ON HERE. HOWEVER, HE DECIDED NOT TO SAY ANYTHINGABOUT IT BECAUSE HE DIDN'T WANT TO BE MADE FUN OF.     "I WANNA TALK TO THE MANAGER," THE FLY DECIDED.     "GOOD," THE TELLER SNEERED. "THE MANAGER WOULD LIKE TO TALK TOALL OF YOU, RIGHT NOW!"     THE TELLER CAME OUT FROM BEHIND THE COUNTER AND LED THEM ALLINTO A ROOM WHICH LOOKED VERY MUCH LIKE A BANK OFFICE. THERE,BEHIND A VERY LARGE DESK, SAT A DISAGREEABLE-LOOKING OLD WOMAN WITHA SOUR EXPRESSION. ERNIE SOMEHOW KNEW THAT THE WOMAN HAD SOMETHINGUNPLEASANT IN MIND FOR THEM.     "WELL, IT'S ABOUT TIME!" SHE SNAPPED AS THEY ENTERED THE ROOM."THERE'S A LITTLE MATTER OF AN UNPAID BALANCE TO BE TAKEN CARE OF!"     ERNIE LOOKED AT THE WOMAN. SHE WAS WEARING A SEVERELY TAILOREDGREY SUIT, WITH HER GREYING HAIR PULLED BACK IN A TIGHT BUN. FORSOME REASON, HOWEVER, SHE WAS WEARING SHOES THAT DIDN'T MATCH HEROUTFIT. THEY WERE A BRILLIANT, SPARKLING RED.     THE FLY APPROACHED THE DESK. "HEY, I GOT THIS CHECK..."     "XUST ONE MINUTE!" THE MANAGER CUT HIM OFF RUDELY. "THERE'S ALITTLE MATTER TO BE TAKEN CARE OF FIRST!" SHE PULLED OUT A SHEAF OFPAPERS. "WE HAVE AN INVOICE HERE FOR `TIME CONTINUUM REPAIR ANDREALITY MAINTENANCE' WHICH WAS REFERRED TO OUR DEPARTMENT FOR NON-PAYMENT. WHICH OF YOU IS GOING TO TAKE CARE OF THIS MATTER?"     STERNO WAS BECOMING IMPATIENT. "WHAT ARE YOU TALKING ABOUT?"     THE MANAGER BEGAN READING FROM THE PAPERS. "IT SEEMS THERE WASA LITTLE PROBLEM WITH CIGARS BUTTS LEFT AT FOUR BILLION B.C."ERNIE GLARED AT STERNO, WHO LOOKED INNOCENTLY OFF INTO THE AIR,TWIDDLING HIS THUMBS. "IT SEEMS THESE FOREIGN MATERIALS LEFT ATSUCH AN EARLY POINT CAUSED SLIME CREATURES TO EVOLVE INTO THEDOMINANT LIFE FORM ON EARTH. PRECLUDING THIS DISGUSTING DEVELOPMENTREZUIRED A MAINTENANCE ORDER WHICH TOOK, LET ME SEE," SHE FLIPPEDTHROUGH THE PAGES AND PULLED OUT A SHEET MARKED "WORK ORDER". "HEREIT IS: ONE MILLION, TWO HUNDRED AND FIFTY-TWO THOUSAND AND THREESTANDARD EARTH YEARS, AND FORTY-FIVE MINUTES. NOW, AT $39.75 PERHOUR, PLUS TIME-AND-A-HALF FOR OVERTIME, AND DOUBLE-TIME ONSUNDAYS, THAT COMES TO," SHE FLIPPED THROUGH SOME MORE PAGES "ONEHUNDRED AND NINETY-FIVE ZUADRILLION, FOUR HUNDRED AND TWELVETRILLION, SEVEN HUNDRED AND SEVENTY-ONE BILLION, TWO HUNDRED ANDTHIRTEEN MILLION, THREE HUNDRED AND TWELVE THOUSAND AND THIRTY-TWODOLLARS AND TWENTY-NINE CENTS." SHE PEERED AT CAPTAIN MEMORY."WOULD YOU LIKE TO TAKE CARE OF THIS BALANCE AT THIS TIME?"     CAPTAIN MEMORY SHRUGGED. "DON'T LOOK AT ME! I DON'T HAVE ANYMONEY."     THE MANAGER PEERED AT THE FLY, WHO LOOKED UNCOMFORTABLE. "HEY,SORRY, BUT I GOT OBLIGATIONS, YOU KNOW? I GOT CAR PAYMENTS, I GOTTAPAY THE RENT..." HE TRAILED OFF.     THE BANK MANAGER LOOKED AT ERNIE. ERNIE LAUGHED. THIS WAS ALLXUST TOO RIDICULOUS. "SURE, PUT IT ON MY CHARGE," HE SAIDFLIPPANTLY.     THE BANK MANAGER SMILED MALICIOUSLY. "MR. ERNEST ROSS," SHESAID IN AN DISAGREEABLE TONE OF VOICE, CAREFULLY WRITING HIS NAMEON THE INVOICE WITH A ZUILL PEN.     CAPTAIN MEMORY LOOKED AT ERNIE, HORRIFIED. "OH, YOU SHOULDN'THAVE SAID THAT," HE SAID IN AN OMINOUS TONE.     ERNIE BEGAN TO GET THE FEELING THAT MAYBE HE HAD MADE A BIGMISTAKE. THE BANK MANAGER LOOKED UP AT HIM. "NOW, WHEN MAY WEEXPECT PAYMENT?"     ERNIE LOOKED DESPERATELY TO THE OTHERS. THEY WERE ALLPOINTEDLY IGNORING HIM. "LOOK," HE SAID URGENTLY. "FORGET I SAIDTHAT, OKAY? I TAKE IT BACK!"     "OH, I'M SORRY," SHE SAID IN A TONE OF MALICIOUS SWEETNESS."I'M AFRAID YOU CAN'T DO THAT. NOW, WILL YOU BE PAYING IN CASH ORBY CHECK?"     "A HUNDRED AND NINETY-FIVE ZUADRILLION DOLLARS," SAID THE FLYWONDERINGLY. "THAT'S A LOT OF MONEY. THAT'S MORE THAN I MAKE IN AWEEK!"     ERNIE WAS BEGINNING TO PANIC. "NO! I WON'T! FORGET IT! I'M NOTGOING TO PAY THAT BILL!"      "YOU'LL PAY THIS BILL, MY FINE LITTLE FRIEND," THE BANKMANAGER CACKLED. "OR I'LL TAKE CARE OF YOU," SHE LOOKED AT STERNO,"AND YOUR LITTLE DOG, TOO!" SHE LAUGHED NASTILY.     "WHAT A WITCH!" THE FLY COMMENTED.     SUDDENLY, ERNIE HAD A BRILLIANT IDEA. HE GRABBED A VASE OFFLOWERS OFF THE DESK, YANKED THE FLOWERS OUT OF IT, AND THREW THEWATER ALL OVER THE BANK MANAGER.     "EEYAH!" SHE SCREAMED. "I'M ALL WET!"     THE FLY LOOKED AT ERNIE WONDERINGLY. "WHY IN THE WORLD DID YOUDO THAT?"     ERNIE LOOKED AT THE BANK MANAGER. SHE WAS GLARING AND HISSINGAT HIM, WATER DRIPPING OFF HER FACE. SHE WAS NOT MELTING AT ALL.ERNIE BECAME UNCOMFORTABLY AWARE OF EVERYONE STARING AT HIM. "UH,WELL, I THOUGHT..." ERNIE STUTTERED.     "YOU'LL HAVE TO EXCUSE OUR FRIEND," CAPTAIN MEMORY AD-LIBBEDZUICKLY. "IT'S THE STRESS, YOU SEE. FINANCIAL PROBLEMS. HE'S NOTCOPING..." THE THREE BEGAN HUSTLING ERNIE TOWARDS THE DOOR.     THE BANK MANAGER AROSE, HISSING AND SPITTING. "YOU HAVEN'THEARD THE LAST OF THIS," SHE SHRIEKED. "YOU'LL SEE!     THE FOUR RUSHED ZUICKLY THROUGH THE BANK AND BACK OUT ONTO THEROAD. THE STOPPED TO GET THEIR BEARINGS.     "WELL, I HOPE YOU'RE SATISFIED," STERNO SAID CONTEMPTUOUSLY TOERNIE. "YOU'VE REALLY MADE A MESS OF THINGS NOW!"     "ME!" CRIED ERNIE. "HEY, I'M NOT THE ONE WHO LEFT THOSE CIGARBUTTS BACK IN FOUR BILLION B.C. IT'S NOT MY FAULT..."     "OH, SURE," STERNO INTERRUPTED. "TRY AND BLAME IT ON ME..."     "HEY, GUYS!" THE FLY BROKE IN. "LOOK AT THAT!"      THE FLY'S HUGE, MULTI-FACETED EYES HAD PICKED UP A DETAIL THEOTHERS HAD FAILED TO NOTICE: BEHIND THE BANK WAS A SMALL, FLAT-ROOFED BRICK BUILDING. A NEON SIGN PROCLAIMED: DEER BAR. THERE WASA LARGE PICTURE OF A DEER BENEATH IT.     "HEY, GUYS, IT'S A BAR!" THE FLY CONTINUED. "WHADDYA SAY WESTOP IN FOR A DRINK? HEY, MAYBE WE CAN MEET SOME GIRLS!"     THE OTHERS LOOKED AT EACH OTHERS CONFUSEDLY. "HEY, IT'S OKAY,GUYS!" THE FLY WENT ON. "I'LL BUY!"     CAPTAIN MEMORY LOOKED RELIEVED. "WELL, IN THAT CASE, SURE!THANKS!" THEY ALL STARTED TOWARDS THE BAR.     ERNIE WAS FINDING ALL OF THIS VERY CONFUSING. EVERY TIME HETHOUGHT HE WAS BEGINNING TO UNDERSTAND WHAT WAS GOING ON, EVENTSTOOK A TURN IN AN ENTIRELY DIFFERENT DIRECTION. WASN'T THISSUPPOSED TO BE THE EMERALD CITY? HE DIDN'T RECALL ANY BARS IN THEEMERALD CITY! AND WHAT ABOUT THAT BANK? AND WHAT HAPPENED TO XUDYGARLAND? THEY ENTERED THE BAR. WELL, ERNIE THOUGHT. I'M NOT SURE IFTHIS IS A GOOD IDEA OR NOT, BUT I COULD REALLY USE A DRINK.     ERNIE FOUND THE INTERIOR OF THE BAR REASSURING. IT WAS COOLAND DARK. IT LOOKED LIKE A TYPICAL CORNER BAR, WITH A TYPICALCORNER BARTENDER. IN ONE CORNER BEHIND THE BAR A TV SET WASMOUNTED, BUT LUCKILY IT WAS TURNED OFF. THERE WERE FEW OTHERCUSTOMERS IN THE PLACE, BUT, OF COURSE, BUSINESS WAS ALWAYS KIND OFSLOW IN THE MIDDLE OF THE DAY. THEY SEATED THEMSELVES AT THE BAR.     THEY BARTENDER, A PORTLY, BALDING MAN SMOKING A CIGAR, CAME UPTO THEM. "WHAT'LL YOU HAVE?"     "WHAT KIND OF BEER YOU GOT?" THE FLY WANTED TO KNOW.     "DEER."     "DEER?" THE FLY WAS PUXXLED.     "DEER BEER," THE BARTENDER STATED MATTER-OF-FACTLY. "THIS ISTHE DEER BAR, WE GOT DEER BEER. YOU WANT IT OR NOT?"     "UH, YEAH, OKAY," THE FLY REPLIED, SOMEWHAT CONFUSED. "UH,THREE DEER BEERS."     ERNIE LOOKED AT THE FLY. IT OCCURRED TO HIM THAT NO-ONE AROUNDHERE SEEMED AT ALL DISTURBED BY THE FLY'S LOOKS. THAT SEEMED TO ABIT ODD. HE WOULD HAVE EXPECTED THE FLY TO HAVE ATTRACTED SOMEWHATMORE ATTENTION.  BUT THEN ON THE OTHER HAND, ERNIE THOUGHT, ITPROBABLY DIDN'T MEAN ANYTHING. AFTER ALL, EVERYTHING IS PRETTYSTRANGE AROUND HERE. ERNIE APPRECIATED THE OPPORTUNITY TO RELAX ANDHAVE A BEER.     THE FLY POINTED INTO THE DARKNESS AT THE FAR END OF THE BAR."HEY, GET A LOAD OF THAT BABE!" HE SAID TO ERNIE, HIS ANTENNAEWAVING EXCITEDLY.      ERNIE PEERED INTENTLY. HE COULD XUST BARELY SEE, IN THE DIMLIGHT, A RATHER DISREPUTABLE-LOOKING YOUNG WOMAN WITH BLEACHEDBLOND HAIR AND A SKIMPY OUTFIT, PERCHED ON A STOOL AT THE FAR ENDOF THE BAR.     "WHAT'S YOUR NAME, DEAR?" THE FLY CALLED OUT TO HER.     "BAMBI," SHE REPLIED.     THE FLY WAS ENCOURAGED. "HEY, WHADDYA SAY WE..."     "COST YOU BUCKS," SHE INTERRUPTED.     THE FLY'S ANTENNAE DROOPED DISPIRITEDLY. "HOW COME THEREAREN'T ANY NICE GIRLS AROUND ANYMORE?" HE TURNED BACK TO HIS BEER.     STERNO LOOKED ABOUT WORRIEDLY. HE SNIFFED. "SOMETHING SMELLSVERY PECULIAR AROUND HERE."     "PROBABLY XUST ONIONS." ERNIE WAS UNCONCERNED.      "HARDLY!" SNIFFED STERNO. "THERE IS SOMETHING SERIOUSLY WRONGABOUT THIS PLACE!"     "NOW WHO'S PARANOID?" ERNIE DISMISSED STERNO'S FEARS.     XUST THEN THE DOOR TO THE BAR OPENED, AND A WOMAN WALKED IN.SHE HAD FLAMING RED HAIR, AND WAS WEARING A 1950'S-STYLE PARTYDRESS. "HI, THERE, FELLAS!" SHE SAID LOUDLY.     "HI!" THE FLY XUMPED UP, HIS ANTENNAE WAVING EXCITEDLY. "SAY,CAN I BUY YOU A DRINK?"     "SURE!" SHE ANSWERED IN A BRASSY VOICE. ERNIE LOOKED AT THEWOMAN. NOT MY TYPE, HE THOUGHT. TOO LOUD. HE LOOKED AT HER AGAIN.SOMETHING ABOUT HER SEEMED VERY FAMILIAR. ERNIE WAS SURE HE HADSEEN HER BEFORE, BUT HE COULDN'T ZUITE REMEMBER WHERE.     "GEE!" SHE SAID TO THE FLY. "YOU SURE ARE DIFFERENT-LOOKING!WHERE ARE YOU FROM?"      THE FLY THOUGHT ZUICKLY. "UH..FRANCE!"     "OH, SURE, I KNOW FRANCE!" THE WOMAN ANSWERED BRIGHTLY. "OOH-LA-LA, C'EST-LA-VIE, EIFFEL TOWER, RIGHT?"     "SURE, YOU GOT IT!" THE FLY WHISPERED ASIDE TO THE OTHERS. "OHBOY, OH BOY, I'M REALLY GETTING SOMEWHERE NOW!" HE TURNED BACK TOTHE WOMAN. "SO, LIKE, WHAT'S YOUR NAME?"     "LUCY," SHE ANSWERED LOUDLY. THE DOOR OPENED AGAIN, AND ASWARTHY MAN WITH SLICKED-BACK BLACK HAIR ENTERED. HE WAS WEARING ACUBAN SHIRT WITH HUGE RUFFLED SLEEVES, AND CARRYING A PAIR OFMARACAS. THE WOMAN GESTURED TOWARDS THE MAN. "AND THIS IS MYHUSBAND, RICKY."     "AWW..." THE FLY'S ANTENNAE DROOPED.     "HOW YOU DO!" SAID THE MAN, WITH A HEAVY SPANISH ACCENT. "I'MRICKY RICARDO, DE FAMOUS CUBAN BANDLEADER." HE SHOOK HIS MARACASRHYTHMICALLY. "CHICK-A-BOOM, CHICK-A-BOOM."     "YEAH. HI." THE FLY ANSWERED GLUMLY. HE TURNED TO THE OTHERS."WOULDN'T YOU KNOW, SHE'S MARRIED." HE WAS OBVIOUSLY DEEPLYDISAPPOINTED. HE BRIGHTENED A BIT. "SAY," HE SAID TO LUCY. "YOUWOULDN'T HAPPEN TO HAVE ANY GIRLFRIENDS YOU COULD ASK OVER, DOYOU?"     "FRIENDS?" SAID LUCY SHRILLY. "SURE, I GOT FRIENDS. IN FACT,A COUPLE OF THEM ARE ON THERE WAY OVER RIGHT NOW!"     THE FLY WAS THRILLED. "OH BOY, OH BOY!" HIS ANTENNAE WAVEDEXCITEDLY. HE TURNED TO RICKY. "HEY, I LIKE THE SHIRT, GUY! IT'STHE NEW `IN' THING, RIGHT?"     "CHURE!" RICKY AGREED. "EES DE LATEST STYLE IN HABANA!"     THE DOOR OPENED, AND IN WALKED AN OLDER COUPLE, ALSO DRESSEDIN 1950'S STYLES. "OH," SAID LUCY. "HERE'S MY FRIENDS NOW. FELLAS,THIS IS FRED AND ETHEL MERTX."     "AWW." THE FLY WAS DISAPPOINTED. THESE WEREN'T THE TYPE OFFRIENDS HE HAD BEEN HOPING FOR.     STERNO LEANED FORWARD. "THERE IS SOMETHING TERRIBLY WRONG WITHTHESE PEOPLE," HE SAID TO ERNIE AND THE CAPTAIN. "I CAN SMELL IT."     "LEAVE ME ALONE," SAID ERNIE. HE HADN'T FORGIVEN STERNO FORBLAMING THE BANK PROBLEM ON HIM.     ALL THESE PEOPLE LOOKED TERRIBLY FAMILIAR TO ERNIE. SUDDENLY,HE HAD IT!     "I'VE GOT IT!" HE SHOUTED.     THE FLY WAS MORE MYSTIFIED THAN EVER. "NOW HE'S GOT IT? WHATIS IT, CONTAGIOUS?" HE EDGED AWAY FROM ERNIE SLIGHTLY.     "NO, NOT THAT!" SAID ERNIE IMPATIENTLY. "I XUSTREMEMBERED...IT'S `I LOVE LUCY'!"     LUCY PUT HER HAND ON ERNIE'S ARM. "I LOVE YOU, TOO." SHE SAID.SHE EDGED CLOSER. "NOW THAT WE'RE FRIENDS, I'D LIKE TO ASK YOU ALITTLE FAVOR."     "WHAT?" ASKED ERNIE SUSPICIOUSLY.      "IT'S XUST A LITTLE THING..." SHE BEGAN HESITANTLY.     "WHAT?" HE EDGED AWAY UNCOMFORTABLY.     "WE'D XUST LIKE TO BORROW IT, XUST FOR A LITTLE WHILE. WE'LLBRING IT RIGHT BACK..."     "WHAT?!" ERNIE WAS GETTING IMPATIENT.     "UM," LUCY SEEMED A BIT EMBARRASSED. "WE'D LIKE TO BORROW YOURBRAIN."     "MY BRAIN!" SHRIEKED ERNIE.     "WE XUST WANT TO BORROW IT," SAID LUCY ZUICKLY. "XUST FOR ALITTLE WHILE. WE'RE NOT GOING TO STEAL IT!" LUCY LAUGHED NERVOUSLY.     "NO!" ERNIE CRIED.     "REALLY, YOU DON'T HAVE ANYTHING TO WORRY ABOUT!" LUCYCONTINUED. "WE'RE NOT GOING TO TAKE IT BACK TO OUR HOME PLANET, ORANYTHING! AND WE'RE CERTAINLY NOT GOING TO PUT IT INTO A GIANTKILLER ROBOT AND USE IT TO TAKE OVER THE EARTH!" SHE LAUGHED. "WEWOULD NEVER DO THAT!" SHE TURNED TO RICKY AND THE MERTX'S. "WOULDWE?"     "OH, NO," THEY ALL LAUGHED. "WE'D NEVER DO THAT! NEVER!"     "THERE, THAT PROVES IT!" LUCY CONCLUDED. "SO, HOW ABOUT IT?"SHE REACHED TOWARDS ERNIE'S HEAD.     "NO!" ERNIE SCREAMED, LEAPING OFF THE BAR STOOL. "KEEP YOURHANDS OFF MY BRAIN!" HE WHIPPED OUT HIS PLASTIC BROADSWORD ANDBRANDISHED IT MENACINGLY.     AFTER STANDING THERE A FEW MOMENTS, ERNIE BECAME AWARE OFEVERYONE LOOKING AT HIM VERY PECULIARLY.     "HEY, GUY," THE FLY INZUIRED. "LIKE, WHAT ARE YOU GONNA DOWITH THAT PLASTIC SWORD?"     ERNIE COULD HEAR THE SOUND OF MUFFLED LAUGHTER, BUT HECOULDN'T TELL WHERE IT WAS COMING FROM. ERNIE GLOWERED. "OKAY,OKAY," HE SAID, REPLACING THE SWORD IN IT'S SHEATH. "XUST KEEP YOURHANDS OFF MY BRAIN, ALL RIGHT?"     LUCY FROWNED. SHE LOOKED AT STERNO, AND THEN LOOKED AT HERCOMPANIONS. "DOG BRAIN?" SHE ASKED THEM. THEY ALL SHOOK THEIRHEADS, NO. SHE LOOKED AT THE FLY. "FLY BRAIN?" SHE ASKED RICKY ANDTHE MERTX'S. "NOPE." THEY SHOOK THEIR HEADS. SHE LOOKED AT CAPTAINMEMORY. SHE SMILED BROADLY. "I WONDER IF I COULD ASK YOU AFAVOR..."SHE BEGAN.     "NO CHANCE!" CAPTAIN MEMORY CUT HER OFF.     HER EXPRESSION BECAME UGLY. EXTREMELY UGLY. IN FACT, THOUGHTERNIE, SHE WAS CHANGING INTO XUST ABOUT THE UGLIEST THING ERNIE HADEVER SEEN. LUCY SNARLED, REVEALING ROWS OF POINTED, REPTILIAN-LOOKING TEETH AND A FORKED TONGUE.     "FOOLISH EARTH CREATURES!" SHE HISSED, PULLING OUT AFRIGHTENING-LOOKING WEAPON. "YOU WILL TURN YOUR BRAINS OVER TO US,OR WE WILL DESTROY THIS MISERABLE PLANET OF YOURS!"     "WHO ARE THESE PEOPLE?" ERNIE WHISPERED TO CAPTAIN MEMORY.     "REMEMBER I TOLD YOU ABOUT THOSE ALIENS?" CAPTAIN MEMORYASKED. ERNIE NODDED. "WELL, HERE THEY ARE!"     "HEY, GUYS, WHAT DO WE DO NOW?" THE FLY ASKED ERNIE ANDCAPTAIN MEMORY, LOOKING AT LUCY'S WEAPON UNEASILY.     CAPTAIN MEMORY LOOKED UP BRIGHTLY. "HEY," HE SAID TO LUCY ANDHER COMPANIONS. "WANNA WATCH SOME TV?"     LUCY AND THE OTHER ALIENS WERE TOTALLY CONFUSED. "WATCH TV? IDON'T REMEMBER THAT! IS THAT IN THE SCRIPT? WHAT ARE WE SUPPOSED TODO?" THEY LOOKED AT EACH OTHER CONFUSEDLY.     "OH, WOW, LOOK WHAT'S ON!" BEFORE ANYONE COULD STOP HIM,CAPTAIN MEMORY HAD REACHED BEHIND THE BAR AND TURNED ON THE TV."IT'S TIME FOR `WHEEL OF TORTURE!'"                             4     AN IMAGE OF STURMBANNFUHRER DR. HEINX VON LIEDERKRANX FILLEDTHE SCREEN. "VIS US TONIGHT," HE BEGAN. "VE HAFF OUR CONTESTANTSFROM OUR LAST SHOW." HE TURNED TO INTRODUCE THEM. "FIRST, CAPTAINMEMORY!" CAPTAIN MEMORY BOWED, TO POLITE APPLAUSE FROM THEAUDIENCE. "GOOMBAH DE BARBARIAN!" ERNIE BLINKED AND STAGGERED. ONCEAGAIN, HE SUDDENLY FOUND HIMSELF ON THE GAME SHOW STAGE. HISSTOMACH FLIPPED OVER ONCE AGAIN. HE HATED THESE ABRUPT CHANGES OFSCENE. "NOT AGAIN," HE MOANED.     CAPTAIN MEMORY SHRUGGED. "HEY, THAT'S SHOW BIX!"     THE AUDIENCE WAS STARING AT ERNIE. THEY SEEMED TO BE EXPECTINGSOMETHING. HE SMILED AND WAVED HALF-HEARTEDLY. THE AUDIENCETITTERED AND APPLAUDED WEAKLY. ERNIE NOTICED THAT THE AUDIENCE WASSTILL MADE UP ENTIRELY OF NAXIS.     HE SIGHED. HE MIGHT HAVE KNOWN HE WOULD WIND UP BACK HERE, HETHOUGHT. WHATEVER THE WORST THING IS THAT COULD POSSIBLY HAPPEN,THAT'S WHAT WILL HAPPEN. ERNIE FROWNED. IN FACT, THIS WAS EVEN THEWORST THING THAT COULDN'T POSSIBLY HAPPEN, AND IT WAS HAPPENINGANYWAY! WASN'T THAT AGAINST MURPHY'S LAW, OR SOMETHING? ANYWAY, ITWAS ALL VERY CONFUSING.     VON LIEDERKRANX TURNED TO THE OTHER SIDE OF THE STAGE. ERNIENOTICED THAT THE ALIENS HAD BEEN TRANSPORTED ONTO THE GAME SHOW ASWELL, AND WERE NOW STAGGERING AND BLINKING, XUST LIKE ERNIE. "UND TONIGHT, VE HAVE VITH US SPECIAL GUESTS," VON LIEDERKRANXSAID, GESTURING TOWARDS THE ALIENS WITH HIS RIDING CROP. "LUCY ANDRICKY RICARDO, THE FAMOUS CUBAN BANDLEADER, AND THEIR FRIENDS, FREDAND ETHEL MERTX." THUNDEROUS APPLAUSE GREETED THE INTRODUCTION.     THE ALIENS WERE UTTERLY CONFUSED. "CHICK-A-BOOM?" ASKED RICKY,SHAKING HIS MARACAS FEEBLY. THE MERTX'S DREW ALIEN WEAPONS,POINTING THEM IN ALL DIRECTIONS UNCERTAINLY.     "UND NOW, XE BIG ZUESTION," VON LIEDERKRANX SAID TO THEALIENS. "VILL YOU TAKE VOT'S IN DIS BAG," HE HELD UP A SMALL PAPERBAG, WHICH LOOKED A LOT LIKE SOMEBODY'S LUNCH. "OR TRY FOR VOT'SBEHIND DOOR NUMBER FOUR!"     THE AUDIENCE WAS HUSHED WITH ANTICIPATION. THE ALIENS LOOKEDAT EACH OTHER IN CONFUSION. "WHAT DO WE DO? I WASN'T PREPARED FORTHIS! I DON'T KNOW WHAT TO DO!" THEY TOLD EACH OTHER.     CAPTAIN MEMORY DECIDED TO HELP THEM OUT. "ANYONE WITH ANYBRAINS WOULD TAKE WHAT'S BEHIND DOOR NUMBER FOUR!" HE HINTED.     THE ALIENS BRIGHTENED. "BRAINS! BRAINS! YES, THAT'S IT! LET'STAKE WHAT'S BEHIND DOOR NUMBER FOUR!" THEY LOOKED PLEASED. "CHICK-A-BOOM!" SAID RICKY DEFINITELY.     "DOOR NUMBER FOUR IT IS!" CALLED OUT VON LIEDERKRANX. THEAUDIENCE ROARED IT'S APPROVAL.     AN ATTRACTIVE WOMAN IN A CHORUS-GIRL OUTFIT OPENED DOOR NUMBERFOUR, AND THE ALIENS FILED IN, LOOKING VERY PLEASED. AS SOON AS THELAST ALIEN WAS INSIDE, THE DOOR SLAMMED WITH A METALLIC CRASH. THECHORUS GIRL REACHED OVER AND DAINTILY LOCKED IT.     IMMEDIATELY, ERNIE BEGAN TO HEAR THE SOUNDS OF COMMOTIONCOMING FROM BEHIND THE DOOR. AT FIRST, POUNDING, THEN THUDS, THENSHRILL, BLOOD-CURDLING SCREAMS. THE SCREAMS CONTINUED FOR SEVERALMINUTES, AND THEN DIED AWAY. FINALLY, ALL WAS SILENT BEHIND DOORNUMBER FOUR.     THE AUDIENCE APPLAUDED. "VELL," VON LIEDERKRANX ANNOUNCEDXOVIALLY. "LOOKS LIKE DEY GOT VOT DEY HAD COMING TO DEM, DOESN'TIT?" HE LAUGHED. HE TURNED TO ERNIE, CAPTAIN MEMORY, AND THEOTHERS. ERNIE NOTICED THAT, WHILE THEIR ATTENTION HAD BEEN DRAWNELSEWHERE, GUARDS WITH MACHINE GUNS HAD SURROUNDED THEM. "SHTILL,IT VAS VERY CONSIDERATE OF DEM TO FIND YOU FOR ME," HE SAID, WITHAN EVIL GLEAM IN HIS EYE. "I VAS AFRAID VE HAD LOST YOU FOREVERAFTER DAT UNFORTUNATE INCIDENT VIT DE ALIEN BLASTER." VONLIEDERKRANX TURNED TO THE GUARD NEAREST HIM. "...FOR VHICH YOU VILLPAY, SCHWEINHUND!" HE LASHED THE GUARD WITH HIS RIDING CROP.     "BUT, HERR DOKTOR," THE GUARD PROTESTED. "I VASN'T EVENTHERE!"     "SHUT UP!" VON LIEDERKRANX SNAPPED. HE TURNED TO CAPTAINMEMORY. "UND NOW, PERHAPS VE VILL CONTINUE VITH XE ZUESTIONS, XA?"HE SMILED SADISTICALLY. "YOU REMEMBER VHERE VE LEFT OFF? VIS XE HOTVHIRLING CORKSCREW?"      A GUARD HANDED VON LIEDERKRANX THE BY-NOW-FAMILIAR DIABOLICAL-LOOKING DEVICE, WHICH BEGAN TO GLOW AND WHIRL. VON LIEDERKRANXSMILED EVILLY. HE BEGAN SLOWLY ADVANCING TOWARD CAPTAIN MEMORY WITHHIS DEVICE.     VON LIEDERKRANX WAS DISTURBED BY THE SOUND OF A KNOCK. HELOOKED AROUND. THERE IT WAS AGAIN; SOMEONE WAS KNOCKING ON THESTAGE DOOR. VON LIEDERKRANX WAS ANNOYED. "ANSWER XE DOOR,DUMMKOPF!" HE SNAPPED AT ONE OF THE GUARDS. THE GUARD OPENED THEDOOR.     "MAILMAN!" A FELLOW IN A POST OFFICE UNIFORM WALKED IN THEDOOR. "GOT A SPECIAL DELIVERY LETTER HERE!"     VON LIEDERKRANX NARROWED HIS EYES SUSPICIOUSLY. "FOR WHO?"     "IS THERE A `MR. ERNEST ROSS' HERE?"      "UH, THAT'S ME," ERNIE SAID.     "HERE YOU GO!" THE MAILMAN HANDED ERNIE A LETTER.     EVERYTHING STOPPED WHILE ERNIE OPENED THE LETTER. VONLIEDERKRANX AND THE NAXIS MILLED ABOUT CONFUSEDLY.     ERNIE WAS TOTALLY MYSTIFIED. WHO COULD BE SENDING HIM ALETTER, HERE? NOBODY KNEW HE WAS HERE, AND EVEN IF THEY DID, WHYWOULD THEY SEND HIM A LETTER HERE? ERNIE TORE THE LETTER OPEN ANDREAD.     "DEAR MR. ROSS,          WE STILL HAVE NOT RECEIVED PAYMENT ON YOUR OUTSTANDINGBALANCE OF  $195,412,771,213,312,032.29. THIS ACCOUNT IS NOW TWOBILLION YEARS OVERDUE. DO NOT FORCE US TO TURN THIS MATTER OVER TOA COLLECTION AGENCY. SEND IN YOUR PAYMENT IMMEDIATELY, BEFORE WEARE REZUIRED TO TAKE FURTHER ACTION.SINCERELY,FIRST NATIONAL BANK OF THE WESTP.S. IF YOU HAVE ALREADY SENT IN YOUR PAYMENT, PLEASE DISREGARDTHIS NOTICE."     ERNIE LOOKED UP. VON LIEDERKRANX WAS WATCHING HIM VERYCAREFULLY. ERNIE HAD AN IDEA. "OOPS, LOOKS LIKE I GOTTA GO PAY ABILL! SEE YA!" ERNIE STARTED TOWARDS THE DOOR.     "NOT SO FAST!" VON LIEDERKRANX BLOCKED ERNIE'S PATH. "GIVE MEDOT LETTER!" HE SNATCHED IT OUT OF ERNIE'S HAND.     DER STURMBANNFUHRER WAS VERY UPSET. HOW DARE THEY INTERRUPTHIS GAME SHOW TO DELIVER A LETTER! AND XUST EXACTLY WHO WAS THISMESSAGE FROM, ANYWAY? AND WHAT DID IT REALLY MEAN?     VON LIEDERKRANX EXAMINED THE LETTER CAREFULLY. "XO," HE SAIDTHOUGHTFULLY. "YOU OWE XE BANK ONE HUNDRED AND NINETY-FIVEZUADRILLION DOLLARS. XUST AS WE THOUGHT!" OF COURSE, IT WASN'TREALLY WHAT HE THOUGHT AT ALL.     THE NAXI'S EYES NARROWED. "XIS ONE HUNDRED AND NINETY-FIVEZUADRILLION DOLLARS, IT IS A GREAT DEAL OF MONEY, XA?"     "XA. I MEAN, YES," AGREED ERNIE.     "IT IS MORE, EVEN, THAN I MAKE IN A VEEK!" VON LIEDERKRANXEYED ERNIE SUSPICIOUSLY. "XO, HOW IS IT DOT YOU COME TO OWE XO MUCHMONEY?"     "WELL, YOU SEE, THERE WAS THIS PROBLEM WITH CIGAR BUTTS TWOBILLION YEARS AGO," ERNIE EXPLAINED NERVOUSLY. HE DIDN'T LIKE THENAXI'S TONE OF VOICE, AND HE PARTICULARLY DIDN'T LIKE THE HOTWHIRLING CORKSCREW. "AND THEN, WE WERE AT THE BANK, AND I HAD TO GOAND OPEN MY BIG MOUTH, AND SO THEN..."     "SCHWEINHUND!" VON LIEDERKRANX WHIPPED ERNIE WITH THE LETTER."DO YOU TAKE ME FOR A FOOL!? NO-ONE COULD POSSIBLY OWE XIS MUCHMONEY! OBVIOUSLY, XIS IS SOME SORT OF SECRET CODE. NOW, WHO VOULDBE SENDING YOU SECRET CODED MESSAGES HERE, ON MEIN OWN GAME SHOW!?"     ERNIE LOOKED PLEADINGLY AT CAPTAIN MEMORY; THE CAPTAIN XUSTSHRUGGED.     VON LIEDERKRANX CONTINUED REFLECTIVELY. "UND HOW COULD XEYKNOW VHERE TO FIND YOU VIS XIS MESSAGE, UNLESS..." HE WHIRLED TOFACE HIS GUARDS. "ONE OF YOU IS A TRAITOR!!"     "NEIN! NEIN!" THE GUARDS BLANCHED AND BACKED AWAY. VONLIEDERKRANX LOOKED AT THE AUDIENCE. "OR PERHAPS, ONE OF YOU!"     "NEIN! NEIN!" THE AUDIENCE CRIED OUT IN UNISON, FIDGETINGUNCOMFORTABLY IN THEIR SEATS.     VON LIEDERKRANX ADVANCED ON THE AUDIENCE, THE HOT WHIRLINGCORKSCREW SPINNING AND GLOWING IN HIS HAND. "XO, YOU VILL NOTCONFESS, EH!?" HE SHRIEKED AT THE AUDIENCE. "PERHAPS A TASTE OF THECORKSCREW VILL LOOSEN YOUR TONGUES!"     ERNIE FELT A TAP ON HIS SHOULDER. CAPTAIN MEMORY BECKONEDTOWARDS THE BACK OF THE STAGE. ALL EYES WERE RIVETED ON VONLIEDERKRANX, AND ON THE HISSING, SPINNING TORTURE DEVICE IN HISHAND. NO-ONE WAS PAYING ANY ATTENTION TO THE FOURSOME. THEY TIPTOEDINTO THE WINGS AND BACK BEHIND THE STAGE. AS THEY LEFT, THEY BEGANTO HEAR SCREAMS COMING FROM SOMEWHERE IN THE AUDIENCE.     THEY HURRIED ALONG THE CORRIDOR LEADING TO THE DRESSING ROOMSBACKSTAGE. UNFORTUNATELY, THERE SEEMED TO BE NO EXITS ANYWHERE INTHAT PART OF THE BUILDING. THE ONLY EXITS WERE THROUGH THE MAINFLOOR, WHICH WOULD HAVE REZUIRED THEM TO GO BACK OUT ONTO THESTAGE. THIS DID NOT SEEM LIKE A VERY GOOD IDEA. AN EMPTY DRESSINGROOM BECKONED AHEAD OF THEM. THEY HURRIED INTO IT AND LOCKED THEDOOR BEHIND THEM. THE SCREAMS WERE STILL AUDIBLE INSIDE THE ROOM.     "HEY, GUYS," THE FLY WANTED TO KNOW. "LIKE, WHAT ARE WE GONNADO NOW?"     ERNIE SNEEXED. "I WISH THEY WOULDN'T KEEP THE AIR CONDITIONINGTURNED UP SO HIGH," HE COMPLAINED, SHIVERING.     "WELL, IF YOU'RE GOING TO GO AROUND WEARING  NOTHING BUT THATRIDICULOUS FUR LOINCLOTH, YOU HAVE TO EXPECT TO GET A CHILL,"COMMENTED STERNO UNSYMPATHETICALLY. " WE'D ALL FEEL A LOT BETTER IFYOU'D COVER UP SOME OF THAT PALLID SKIN OF YOURS."     "HEY, THAT'S AN IDEA!" THE FLY CHIMED IN. "THIS IS A DRESSINGROOM! MAYBE THERE'S SOME CLOTHES HERE YOU CAN WEAR!"     THAT SEEMED LIKE A GOOD IDEA TO ERNIE. HE'D BEEN UNCOMFORTABLYCOLD EVER SINCE HE'D PUT THAT SILLY LOINCLOTH ON. HE BEGAN LOOKINGTHROUGH THE CLOSET, BUT FOUND ONLY FILMY NEGLIGEES AND HAREM-GIRLOUTFITS.     "HEY, THERE'S A WHOLE WARDROBE ROOM NEXT DOOR," THE FLYPOINTED TO AN ADXOINING ROOM. "TAKE A LOOK IN THERE!" ERNIEDISAPPEARED INTO THE NEXT ROOM.     STERNO WAS SEARCHING THE ROOM CAREFULLY. "WHAT'CHA LOOKINGFOR, SECRET PASSAGES?" THE FLY ASKED EAGERLY.     "ACTUALLY, I WAS RATHER HOPING SOMEONE MIGHT HAVE LEFT A SPOTOF BRANDY ABOUT," HE ANSWERED. "AHA!" HE PULLED OUT A BOTTLE. ALOOK OF DISAPPOINTMENT APPEARED ON HIS FACE. "MD 20/20?" HE ASKED."WHAT IN THE WORLD COULD THAT BE?"     "OH, WOW," COMMENTED THE FLY. "MAD DOG!"     "I BEG YOUR PARDON!" SNAPPED STERNO HUFFILY.     "HEY, NO OFFENSE!" SAID THE FLY ZUICKLY. "THAT'S XUST WHATIT'S CALLED, YOU KNOW?"     "HMMPH!" STERNO OPENED THE BOTTLE AND SNIFFED THE CONTENTS."DREADFUL!" HE PROCLAIMED, AND DROPPED THE BOTTLE IN THE TRASH.     ERNIE REAPPEARED FROM THE WARDROBE ROOM. HE WAS NOW CLAD IN ASPANISH TOREADOR OUTFIT, CONSISTING OF A SCINTILLATING GOLD SUIT,COVERED WITH SEZUINS, WITH KNEE BREECHES AND WHITE STOCKINGS, AWHITE SHIRT AND TIE, AND AN ODD-SHAPED LITTLE BLACK HAT.     HE NOTICED EVERYONE LOOKING AT HIM ODDLY. "HEY, IT WAS THEONLY THING I COULD FIND, YOU KNOW? ERNIE SAID DEFENSIVELY. "ATLEAST IT'S WARM!"     STERNO SNIFFED. "I MUST SAY, YOU HAVE THE MOST AWFUL TASTE INCLOTHES! BUT, AT LEAST IT'S BETTER THAN LOOKING AT THAT SICKENINGBODY OF YOURS!"     ERNIE WAS OFFENDED. "WHAT'S WRONG WITH MY BODY?"     STERNO ROLLED HIS EYES UPWARD SILENTLY.     ONLY THE FLY SEEMED TO APPROVE OF ERNIE'S NEW OUTFIT. "HEY,GUY," HE SAID ENTHUSIASTICALLY. "I LIKE THE SUIT! IT'S THE NEW `IN'THING, RIGHT?"     STERNO REGARDED ERNIE CRITICALLY. "WHY ARE YOU STILL CARRYINGTHAT RIDICULOUS PLASTIC BROADSWORD?"     ERNIE SHIFTED UNCOMFORTABLY. "HEY, I TOLD YOU, IT'S A FORTYBUCK DEPOSIT!"     STERNO ROLLED HIS EYES UPWARD. "HOPELESS!"     ERNIE SAT DOWN IN A COMFORTABLE-LOOKING CHAIR. HE THOUGHT HEHAD BETTER TAKE ADVANTAGE OF EVERY OPPORTUNITY TO REST; HE HAD NOWAY OF KNOWING HOW LONG ALL OF THIS CRAXINESS WAS GOING TOCONTINUE.     "SO, LIKE, WHAT'S WITH THAT LUCY CHICK?" THE FLY ASKED CAPTAINMEMORY. "I MEAN, LIKE, WHAT'S HER PROBLEM?"     "OH, SHE'S AN ALIEN," EXPLAINED THE CAPTAIN.     "A WHAT?"     "YOU KNOW," THE CAPTAIN WENT ON. "COME FROM OUTER SPACE,INVADE THE EARTH, STEAL YOUR BRAIN, THAT KINDA STUFF." THE CAPTAINMADE HIMSELF COMFORTABLE ON A SMALL SOFA, AND BEGAN LEAFING THROUGHHIS COPY OF THE TV GUIDE.     "ALIENS?" ERNIE ASKED CONFUSEDLY. "ARE THEY REALLY ALIENS?"     "THERE AS REAL AS ANYTHING IN CYBERSPACE, I SUPPOSE," THECAPTAIN COMMENTED.     "BUT WHAT ARE THEY DOING HERE?" ERNIE WANTED TO KNOW.     "THEY'RE PART OF A GAME CALLED `MENACE FROM PLANET XERO'. IT'SZUITE POPULAR," THE CAPTAIN EXPLAINED. "I FIGURED WE'D RUN ACROSSIT SOONER OR LATER. WITH ALL THE SYSTEMS WALDO'S BEEN TAKING OVER,THE ODDS ARE THAT IT'D BE IN AT LEAST ONE OF THEM."     THE FLY SEEMED A BIT SKEPTICAL. "WELL, GEE, THAT CHICK SUREDIDN'T LOOK LIKE AN ALIEN!"     THE CAPTAIN WAS IMPATIENT. "SHE'S IN DISGUISE, OF COURSE! YOUWOULDN'T WANT TO SEE WHAT SHE REALLY LOOKS LIKE!" HE SHUDDERED."ANYWAY," HE CONTINUED. "THAT WHOLE BUNCH ARE ALIENS IN DISGUISE.THEY'VE BEEN WATCHING OUR 1950'S TV SHOWS, AND THEY THINK THOSE TVCHARACTERS ARE NORMAL EARTH PEOPLE. THEY THINK IF THEY DISGUISETHEMSELVES AS 1950'S TV CHARACTERS, YOU EARTH PEOPLE WILL NEVERKNOW THE DIFFERENCE."     "THEY DON'T SEEM TO BE VERY SMART," ERNIE COMMENTED.     "WELL, YOU KNOW," SAID THE CAPTAIN THOUGHTFULLY. "INTELLIGENCEIS NOT THE ONLY WAY TO APPROACH REALITY. THERE ARE OTHER WAYS OFTHINKING. IT'S POSSIBLE TO APPROACH PROBLEM-SOLVING FROM ANENTIRELY DIFFERENT PERSPECTIVE. THERE ARE CIVILIXATIONS IN WHICHTHINKING IS DONE IN AN ENTIRELY DIFFERENT WAY, WHERE `INTELLIGENCE'IS REPLACED BY A WHOLE DIFFERENT WAY OF LOOKING AT THE UNIVERSE!"     ERNIE HAD NEVER HEARD CAPTAIN MEMORY GET SO PHILOSOPHICALBEFORE. "SO, DO THESE ALIENS HAVE A COMPLETELY DIFFERENT WAY OFTHINKING?" HE ASKED WONDERINGLY.     "NO," SAID THE CAPTAIN REFLECTIVELY. "THEY'RE XUST STUPID."HE RETURNED TO HIS TV GUIDE.     "I MIGHTA KNOWN," SAID THE FLY REFLECTIVELY. "AFTER ALL, SHE'SHANGING OUT WITH THAT RICKY GUY! MAN, HE'S SOMETHING ELSE! ANYBODYWHO'D WEAR A SHIRT LIKE THAT..." HE TRAILED OFF, LOOKING SIDEWAYSAT ERNIE.     A NUMBER OF MAGAXINES WERE SCATTERED ABOUT AN END TABLE NEXTTO ERNIE'S CHAIR. A HEADLINE IN ONE OF THE CAUGHT ERNIE'S EYE:"FANTASTIC ARCHAEOLOGICAL FIND REVEALED!" ERNIE PICKED IT UP ANDBEGAN TO READ:     "ON OCTOBER 16, 1978, AN ARAB SHEPHERD FOLLOWING A STRAYANIMAL INTO A CAVE NEAR THE SEA OF GALILEE MADE AN INCREDIBLE FIND- A FIND UNPARALLELED IN MODERN HISTORY. A FIND SO MONUMENTAL, SOEARTH-SHATTERING, SO THREATENING TO WORLD GOVERNMENTS AND RELIGIOUSINSTITUTIONS THAT ITS VERY EXISTENCE HAS BEEN SUPPRESSED. ONLY NOW,BY MEANS OF SMUGGLED DOCUMENTS OBTAINED AT GREAT PERSONAL RISK TOALL INVOLVED, CAN THIS FABULOUS STORY COME TO LIGHT  - THE STORY OFTHE DEAD SEA PHONOGRAPH RECORDS!"     ERNIE WAS INTRIGUED. HE READ ON:     "OUR STORY MUST REALLY BEGIN IN ANCIENT EGYPT - DEEP IN THEMYSTERIES OF THE MIDDLE KINGDOM; AN AGE WHICH PRODUCED SOME OF THEGREATEST WONDERS THE WORLD HAS EVEN SEEN. SOME OF THESE, LIKE THEPYRAMIDS, HAVE BEEN KNOWN TO THE WORLD FOR MILLENNIA. YET IT STANDSTO REASON THAT ANY PEOPLE CAPABLE OF PRODUCING WONDERS LIKE THESE,WONDERS WHICH THE MODERN WORLD HAS YET TO EZUAL, MUST ALSO HAVEBEEN CAPABLE OF PRODUCING MANY OTHER AMAXING THINGS ON A SMALLERSCALE. YET, ALL OF THESE HAVE BEEN LOST IN THE SANDS OF TIME - ORHAVE THEY?     LET US CONSIDER FOR A MOMENT THE PHONOGRAPH - A RELATIVELYSIMPLE DEVICE INVENTED IN THE LAST CENTURY BY THOMAS EDISON. IN ITSBASIC FORM IT CONSISTS OF A DISC, OR EVEN A CYLINDER, DRIVEN BY ACRANK, THAT COMES IN CONTACT WITH A NEEDLE ATTACHED TO A CONE. ONECAN THEN EITHER PLAY OR RECORD SIMPLY BY TURNING THE CRANK ANDEITHER SPEAKING INTO THE CONE, OR LISTENING. THAT'S ALL THERE IS TOIT. A SIMPLE DEVICE LIKE THIS CAN BE MADE WITH ALMOST ANYONE WITHBASIC TOOLS. IT COULD HAVE BEEN MADE THOUSANDS OF YEARS AGO - ITCOULD EVEN HAVE BEEN MADE BY THE ANCIENT EGYPTIANS! CERTAINLY, ANYCIVILIXATION CAPABLE OF PRODUCING INCREDIBLE ENGINEERING FEATS LIKETHE PYRAMIDS WOULD BE CAPABLE OF CONSTRUCTING A SIMPLE MECHANICALDEVICE LIKE THIS!     NOW THERE IS EVIDENCE THAT THEY DID! IN THE TOMB OF THEPHARAOH PEPTO II AT BISMOL, HIEROGLYPHICS HAVE BEEN FOUND WHICHBEAR AN UNCANNY RESEMBLANCE TO EDISON'S EARLY PHONOGRAPHS. ALONGWITH THESE WERE OTHERS WHICH WERE TRANSLATED TO READ "...AND THEVOICE OF THE PHARAOH SHALL SPEAK ON AFTER HE IS GONEAND...(FRAGMENT MISSING)...THAT WE, WHO ARE AS DOGS TO THE MIGHTYPHARAOH, SHALL LISTEN TO OUR MASTER'S VOICE!"     ERNIE LOOKED AT THE ACCOMPANYING ILLUSTRATION. IT WAS APICTURE FROM AN EGYPTIAN TOMB, SHOWING A DOG LISTENING TO SOME KINDOF A DEVICE WITH A CONE COMING OUT OF IT. IT REMINDED ERNIE OFSOMETHING. DIDN'T IT LOOK A LOT LIKE...THE RCA VICTOR LOGO? THENAGAIN, MAYBE NOT. HE CONTINUED READING.     "BUT THIS IS ONLY THE BEGINNING! IT WOULD BE MONUMENTAL ENOUGHIF RECORDS OF THE VOICES OF THE PHARAOHS HAD BEEN FOUND, BUT WHATHAS ACTUALLY BEEN DISCOVERED IS SO SPECTACULAR AS TO MAKE THEPHARAOHS SEEM TRIVIAL BY COMPARISON. IT WAS, OF COURSE, PHONOGRAPHRECORDS THAT THE ARAB SHEPHERD FOUND. THEY WERE IN THE FORM OFDISCS MADE OF FINE CLAY, A MATERIAL MUCH MORE DURABLE THAN THEPERISHABLE VINYL THAT OUR PRESENT-DAY PHONOGRAPH RECORDS ARE MADEOF, AND WERE PACKED IN THE CRUMBLING REMAINS OF AN EGYPTIAN-STYLECASE. WHEN PLAYED AT APPROXIMATELY 78 RPM, THEY PRODUCED VOICES,MUCH LIKE OUR OWN EARLY PHONOGRAPH RECORDS.     BUT - STOP AND CONSIDER. THESE RECORDS WERE FOUND DEEP INISRAEL, NEAR THE SEA OF GALILEE - IN OTHER WORDS, NOWHERE NEAR THEEGYPT OF THE PHARAOHS. THERE IS NO EVIDENCE THAT THE PHONOGRAPH WASEVER USED IN ANCIENT ISRAEL; WHAT'S MORE, THEY WERE IN AN EGYPTIAN-STYLE CASE, AND BORE EGYPTIAN MARKINGS. HOW COULD THEY HAVE COME TOA CAVE NEAR THE SEA OF GALILEE?     THERE IS ONLY ONE WAY: THEY MUST HAVE BEEN BROUGHT THERE, FROMEGYPT - BY THE FLEEING ISRAELITES! HIEROGLYPHICS PROVE THAT THEPHONOGRAPH WAS IN EXISTENCE AT THIS TIME; WHAT WOULD HAVE BEEN MOREREASONABLE THAN FOR THE FLEEING ISRAELITES, TAKING WITH THEM THETREASURES OF EGYPT, TO TAKE WITH THEM THIS GREAT TREASURE?     BUT WHAT WOULD THEY HAVE USED IT FOR? WHAT ELSE BUT FOR THESAME USE AS THE PHARAOHS, TO RECORD AND PRESERVE THE VOICE OF THEIRLEADER, SO THAT HIS WILL CAN BE KNOWN FOREVER - THE VOICE OF MOSES!     YET, IF THIS DEVICE, THE PHONOGRAPH, WAS IN THE HANDS OFMOSES, WOULDN'T HE HAVE USED IT TO RECORD THE THINGS HE CONSIDEREDOF GREATEST IMPORTANCE? IN THAT CASE, WOULDN'T HE HAVE TAKEN IT TOMOUNT SINAI? WOULDN'T HE HAVE USED IT TO RECORD - THE VOICE OF GODHIMSELF?     NOW YOU CAN SEE WHY THIS FIND HAS BEEN SUPPRESSED - WHY NOGOVERNMENT, NO RELIGIOUS INSTITUTION ON EARTH CAN AFFORD TO LETTHESE RECORDS BE HEARD. THEY CONTAIN AT THE VERY LEAST THE VOICE OFMOSES, AND POSSIBLY EVEN THE VERY VOICE OF GOD. THERE MAY BE THINGSON THESE RECORDS WHICH COULD CHANGE THE LIFE OF EVERY MAN, WOMAN,AND CHILD ON EARTH - NOW, TODAY, IN THE 20TH CENTURY.     BUT WILL THESE RECORDS EVER BE HEARD? OR WILL THEY BE HIDDENAWAY IN A SECRET VAULT, KEPT FROM A WORLD THAT NEEDS THEM SODESPERATELY?     THEY MUST BE HEARD! THE PEOPLE HAVE A RIGHT TO THIS KNOWLEDGE,KNOWLEDGE WHICH AFFECTS EACH AND EVERY ONE OF THEM IN EVERY FACETOF THEIR DAILY LIVES. RIGHT NOW THERE IS NO WAY OF KNOWING WHERETHEY ARE BEING HELD, OR BY WHOM, OR FOR WHAT PURPOSE. BUT A FINDLIKE THIS CANNOT BE SUPPRESSED. IT IS TO EARTH-SHAKING, TOOMONUMENTAL. WORD WILL LEAK OUT, PEOPLE WILL BE TOLD! ALREADY THISHAS BEGUN TO HAPPEN - SECRET DOCUMENTS HAVE BEEN SMUGGLED OUT;INCONTROVERTIBLE EVIDENCE HAS BEEN UNCOVERED. IT IS BEGINNING - NOWIT IS ONLY A MATER OF TIME BEFORE THE WORLD LEARNS THE AWESOMETRUTH ABOUT THE DEAD SEA PHONOGRAPH RECORDS!"          ERNIE PUT THE MAGAXINE DOWN. WOW, HE THOUGHT. THIS IS REALLYHEAVY. IS THIS FOR REAL, OR IS THIS XUST MORE CRAXY NONSENSE? DIDTHIS REALLY HAPPEN, OR IS THIS XUST MORE GARBAGE CAUSED BY STICKINGTOGETHER TOO MANY COMPUTER PROGRAMS THAT DON'T BELONG TOGETHER? HOWCAN WE TELL THE DIFFERENCE?     ERNIE THOUGHT ABOUT THE PROBLEM. THIS IS AN IMPORTANTZUESTION, HE DECIDED. WE MAY HAVE STUMBLED ONTO SOMETHING REALLYMEANINGFUL. SOMEBODY OUGHT TO LOOK INTO THIS. SOMEBODY OUGHT TOFIND OUT WHETHER THIS IS FOR REAL OR NOT, BECAUSE IF IT IS REAL ITMIGHT BE...REALLY IMPORTANT! ERNIE STOPPED. HE HADN'T THE VAGUESTIDEA HOW SOMEBODY WOULD GO ABOUT LOOKING INTO A ZUESTION LIKE THIS.     ERNIE LOOKED AT CAPTAIN MEMORY. "HERE, LOOK AT THIS ARTICLE."HE HANDED THE MAGAXINE TO THE CAPTAIN.     THE CAPTAIN PEERED AT THE ARTICLE. "THE DEAD SEA PHONOGRAPHRECORDS? GET REAL!" CAPTAIN MEMORY TOSSED THE MAGAXINE OVER HISSHOULDER.       "NO, REALLY!" ERNIE PROTESTED. "THIS IS IMPORTANT STUFF! IREALLY THINK YOU SHOULD CONSIDER IT! WHAT IF THIS REALLY HAPPENED?WHAT IF THIS IS, LIKE A SECRET CIA COMPUTER FILE OR SOMETHING? IMEAN, STUFF LIKE THAT COULD BE HERE, RIGHT? IT'S POSSIBLE, ISN'TIT?"     "AYTHING'S POSSIBLE," THE CAPTAIN ADMITTED. "BUT HOW LIKELY ISIT?"     ERNIE HEARD SNICKERING COMING FROM BEHIND HIM. HE TURNED.STERNO HAD PICKED UP THE MAGAXINE, AND WAS LEAFING THROUGH IT.     "YOU ACTUALLY READ THIS STUFF?" LAUGHED STERNO. "HERE'S A GOODARTICLE: `PRINCESS DIANA SAYS, I'M CARRYING ELVIS'S BABY'. OR, HOWABOUT `I WAS RAPED BY KILLER LESBIANS FROM OUTER SPACE'".     ERNIE FROWNED. SOMETHING ABOUT THAT LAST HEADLINE SOUNDED ALITTLE FAMILIAR.     STERNO CONTINUED. "HERE ANOTHER ONE: `EARTH INVADED BY ALIENSDISGUISED AS 1950'S TV CHARACTERS'."     "HEY, LEMME SEE THAT!" ERNIE REACHED FOR THE MAGAXINE,CONVINCED THAT THEY WERE ONTO SOMETHING.     "WHAT TRASH!" STERNO DROPPED THE MAGAXINE IN THE WASTEBASKET.     "HEY!" ERNIE FISHED THROUGH THE WASTEBASKET, TRYING TORETRIEVE THE MAGAXINE. "OH NO, IT'S ALL COVERED WITH STICKY WINE!THE PAGES ARE ALL STUCK TOGETHER!"     "WOW, MAN," SAID THE FLY WONDERINGLY. "THAT'S REALLY HEAVYSTUFF. IMAGINE THAT: PRINCESS DIANA PREGNANT WITH ELVIS'S BABY. INEVER KNEW THAT!"     ERNIE WAS TRYING TO SEPARATE THE PAGES OF THE MAGAXINE, BUTTHE MAD DOG WINE HAD DISSOLVED MOST OF THE INK, AND HE WAS ONLYSUCCEEDING IN MAKING A BIG MESS.      "DID YOU REALLY THINK YOU WERE GOING TO FIND THE SECRETS OFTHE UNIVERSE IN THAT MAGAXINE?" ASKED STERNO SARCASTICALLY.     "I DON'T THINK YOU'RE GOING TO GET ANYWHERE WITH THAT STUFF,"ADDED CAPTAIN MEMORY. "I THINK YOU'RE BARKING UP THE WRONG TREE!"     "I SUPPOSE YOU THINK THAT'S FUNNY!" STERNO SNARLED.  HE REGARDED ERNIE FOR A MOMENT. "YOU KNOW, THAT LITTLE HAT LOOKSREALLY RIDICULOUS!"     "YEAH, GUY," THE FLY CHIMED IN. "HOW COME YOU'RE WEARING THATMICKEY MOUSE HAT?"     "IT'S NOT A MICKEY MOUSE HAT, ALRIGHT?" SAID ERNIE,FRUSTRATED. "IT'S PART OF THE OUTFIT. YOU'RE SUPPOSED TO WEAR THISKIND OF A LITTLE HAT. I DUNNO WHY, YOU'RE XUST SUPPOSED TO!" ERNIESULKED. "LEAVE ME ALONE!"     STERNO CHUCKLED. "THE ONLY GOOD THING ABOUT HAVING HIM ALONG,"HE SAID, GESTURING AT ERNIE. "IS THAT HE CAN ALWAYS CHEER ME UP. IFI DIDN'T HAVE HIM TO LAUGH AT, I DON'T KNOW WHAT I'D DO!" ERNIEGLOWERED.     THE FLY WAS SITTING AT A DRESSING TABLE, REGARDING HIMSELF INTHE MIRROR. HE KEPT EXAMINING VARIOUS BOTTLE OF COSMETICS, HOLDINGEACH IN TURN UP TO HIS FACE, BUT HE COULDN'T FIND ANY THAT MATCHEDHIS SHELL TONE.     "MY, WHAT BIG EYES YOU HAVE!" ZUIPPED STERNO. "HOW ABOUT SOMEEYELINER? OR MAYBE SOME MASCARA FOR YOUR ANTENNA?"     "AW, C'MON GUYS," THE FLY COMPLAINED. "GIMME A BREAK, HUH? IWAS XUST LOOKING FOR A LITTLE, LIKE, BRONXER, Y'KNOW? Y'THINKBRONXER WOULD LOOK GOOD ON ME?" HIS ANTENNAE WAVED HOPEFULLY.     ERNIE WAS FEELING IRRITABLE. HE WAS TIRED OF EVERYONE PICKINGON HIM ALL THE TIME. "WHY DO YOU KEEP READING THAT TV GUIDE?" HESNAPPED AT CAPTAIN MEMORY.     "SO I CAN SEE WHAT'S ON," ANSWERED THE CAPTAIN REASONABLY.     "HOW CAN YOU POSSIBLY TELL WHAT'S ON, WHEN YOU DON'T EVEN KNOWWHERE WE ARE? YOU'RE NEVER GONNA HAVE THE RIGHT LISTINGS FOR HERE,WHEREVER THIS IS!"     "SURE I DO," DISAGREED THE CAPTAIN. "I'VE GOT THE LISTINGS FOREVERYWHERE."     "HOW COULD YOU HAVE THAT?" ERNIE WAS SKEPTICAL.     "THIS IS THE INTER-CONTINUUM EDITION, WITH MULTI-GALACTIC SUB-LISTINGS, FOR THE WEEK OF MAY 3-INFINITY," EXPLAINED THE CAPTAIN."IT'S GOT THE LISTINGS FOR ALL OF TIME AND SPACE."     "LEMME SEE THAT!" ERNIE SNATCHED IT RUDELY OUT OF CAPTAINMEMORY'S HAND. "WHY, THE PAGES ARE ALL BLANK!"     "ARE YOU A SUBSCRIBER?" THE CAPTAIN WANTED TO KNOW, GENTLYTAKING THE BOOK BACK OUT OF ERNIE'S HANDS.     "WELL, NO," ERNIE ADMITTED.     "WELL, THAT'S WHY YOU CAN'T SEE IT!"      ERNIE SIGHED. HE GUESSED THAT MADE AS MUCH SENSE AS ANYTHINGELSE.     CM EXAMINED THE LISTINGS CAREFULLY. "WANNA WATCH AN OLD MOVIE?HERE'S A CLASSIC: `MR. BLANDINGS BUILDS HIS DREAM HORSE'."     ERNIE FROWNED. "YOU MEAN `HOUSE'."     CAPTAIN MEMORY WAS PUXXLED. "MR. HOUSE BUILDS HIS DREAMHORSE'?"     ERNIE SHOOK HIS HEAD. "NO, NO. IT'S SUPPOSED TO BE `MR.BLANDINGS BUILDS HIS DREAM HOUSE'."     CAPTAIN MEMORY PEERED AT THE TV GUIDE. "IT ZUITE CLEARLY SAYSHERE `HORSE'."     "THAT'S RIDICULOUS!" ERNIE INSISTED. "YOU CAN'T BUILD AHORSE!"     "THAT'S RIGHT!" THE FLY CHIMED IN. "AT LEAST, NOT WITHOUT APERMIT!"     "HUH?" ERNIE WAS TAKEN ABACK.     "AND AN INSPECTION!" THE FLY WENT ON. "I MEAN, YOU WOULDN'TWANT TO RIDE A HORSE THAT WAS BUILT WITHOUT A PERMIT, AND WASN'TINSPECTED! IT WOULDN'T BE SAFE!"     "UH..." SOMETHING ABOUT THIS DIDN'T SOUND RIGHT TO ERNIE.     THE FLY CONTINUED WITH ENTHUSIASM. "I MEAN, LIKE WHAT IF YOUTOOK THIS HORSE OUT ON THE FREEWAY, YOU KNOW, AND YOU'RE CRUISIN'ALONG, DOIN' MAYBE 60, AND ALL OF A SUDDEN - BOOM! A LEG FALLS OFF!THEN WHAT? SOMEBODY COULD GET HURT!"     ERNIE DIDN'T KNOW HOW TO ARGUE WITH THIS. "UH, I SUPPOSEYOU'RE RIGHT." HE FELL SILENT.     CAPTAIN MEMORY BROKE THE SILENCE. "HEY, HERE'S A GOOD SHOW!8:30 - `FOLLOW THE YELLOW BRICK ROAD'. THE FAB FOUR STOP FOR ADRINK AT THE DEER BAR, AND MEET ALIENS DISGUISED AS 1950'S TVCHARACTERS.' STARRING LUCILLE BALL, ADAM WEST, AND RIN-TIN-TIN. HOWABOUT THAT?"     "SOUNDS OKAY TO ME," SAID THE FLY AGREEABLY.     ERNIE LOOKED AROUND THE ROOM. "THERE'S NO TV!" HE SAIDTRIUMPHANTLY.     "OH, THERE'S ALWAYS A TV!" THE CAPTAIN ASSURED HIM.     "OKAY, WHERE?" ERNIE DEMANDED.     "HMM." CAPTAIN MEMORY LOOKED AROUND. HE GOT UP, WALKED OVER TOTHE DRESSING TABLE, AND PEERED INTO THE MIRROR. "LET'S TRY THIS:           `MIRROR, MIRROR, ON THE WALL,           AIN'T THERE NO TV AT ALL?'"     THE SURFACE OF THE MIRROR DISSOLVED, AND AN IMAGE OF THE DEERBAR APPEARED IN ITS PLACE. FOUR CHARACTERS WERE SEATED AT THE BAR,DRINKING BEER.     "SO, WHAT ARE WE GONNA DO NOW, GUYS?" ASKED THE FLY, SIPPINGA BEER THROUGH HIS LONG, FLEXIBLE SNOUT.     ERNIE STARTED, AND LOOKED ABOUT CONFUSEDLY. THEY WERE SUDDENLYALL BACK AT THE DEER BAR. HIS STOMACH FLIPPED OVER AGAIN."WHAT...UH..HOW DID WE GET BACK HERE?"     "SAME WAY WE GOT OUT," SAID CAPTAIN MEMORY, GESTURING TOWARDSTHE TV SET. HE LOOKED MOMENTARILY CONFUSED. "EITHER THAT, OR MAYBEWE NEVER REALLY LEFT AT ALL. I FORGET WHICH. OH WELL, IT DOESN'TREALLY MATTER."     ERNIE LOOKED UP AT THE TELEVISION ABOVE THE BAR, WHICH NOW WASTURNED ON. A SADISTIC NAXI TALK SHOW HOST WAS USING A DIABOLICAL-LOOKING DEVICE TO TORTURE MEMBERS OF THE AUDIENCE. "UH, DO YOU MINDIF I TURN THAT OFF?" ASKED ERNIE.     "IF YOU LIKE," ANSWERED THE CAPTAIN INDIFFERENTLY.     ERNIE SWITCHED OFF THE SET, AND BREATHED A SIGH OF RELIEF. NOWTHEY WERE SAFE. HE FROWNED. WELL, MAYBE THEY WEREN'T SAFE, BUT THEYWERE SAFER. HE THOUGHT ABOUT IT A MOMENT. WELL, MAYBE THEY WEREN'TREALLY ANY SAFER, BUT TURNING THE TV OFF MADE HIM FEEL BETTER XUSTTHE SAME. THAT SATISFIED HIM, SO HE RETURNED TO HIS SEAT.     THE FLY LOOKED AROUND. "LIKE, WE'RE THE ONLY ONES HERE!"     "UH HUH," ERNIE AGREED.     "SO, WHAT HAPPENED TO, LIKE, RICKY AND LUCY?"     AS IF IN ANSWER, THE DOOR TO THE BAR FLEW OPEN, AND INSTAGGERED RICKY, HIS RUFFLED CUBAN SHIRT IN RAGS, HIS MARACASBROKEN. CLOSE BEHIND HIM WAS LUCY, HER HAIR DISARRAYED, HER PARTYDRESS TORN AND SMEARED WITH DIRT.     "YOU FEELTHY PEEG!" SHRIEKED RICKY, ENRAGED. "YOU SEND USBEHIND DOOR NUMERO FOUR! I KEEL YOU!"     "WHAT DID HE SAY?" THE FLY ASKED CONFUSEDLY. "I CAN'TUNDERSTAND HIS ACCENT AT ALL!"     "I THINK HE SAID HE WAS GOING TO `KEEL' US," STERNOVOLUNTEERED.     "WHAT'S THAT?" THE FLY WANTED TO KNOW. "SOMETHING TO DO WITHBOATS?"     RICKY ADVANCED ON THE FOURSOME, HOLDING HIS SHATTERED MARACASMENACINGLY. ERNIE NOTICED THAT THEY SEEMED TO HAVE ACZUIRED VERYSHARP EDGES. "I KEEL YOU, I CUT YOUR BRAIN OUT!" HE THREATENEDERNIE.     "HEY, HE'S STARTING UP WITH THAT `BRAIN' STUFF AGAIN," ERNIESAID TO CAPTAIN MEMORY. "WHAT DO WE DO?"     "HAVE A BEER," SAID CAPTAIN MEMORY, SIPPING HIS DEER BEER.     "THAT'S EASY FOR YOU TO SAY! IT'S NOT YOUR BRAIN HE'S AFTER!"ERNIE LOOKED AT RICKY APPREHENSIVELY.     "WHY DON'T YOU XUST LET HIM HAVE YOUR BRAIN?" SNICKEREDSTERNO. "YOU'LL NEVER MISS IT!"     RICKY SLOWLY STAGGERED FORWARD. ERNIE NOTICED THAT RICKY WASGETTING MUCH MORE, SORT OF, REPTILIAN-LOOKING. HE SEEMED TO HAVEACZUIRED LONG, SHARP TEETH, AND A FORKED TONGUE, WHICH FLITTED INAND OUT OF HIS MOUTH IN A SNAKE-LIKE MANNER.     "HEY UH, SHOULDN'T WE, UH, DO SOMETHING?" ERNIE URGED CAPTAINMEMORY.     THE CAPTAIN LOOKED ANNOYED. "OH, ALL RIGHT!" HE CLEARED HISTHROAT. "AND NOW," HE ANNOUNCED POMPOUSLY. "A WORD FROM OURSPONSOR!"     RICKY FROXE. "OH, EES A COMMERCIAL," HE SAID TO LUCY. "WE GOTTO WAIT!"     "WELL, I GUESS WE'D BETTER GET GOING, FELLAS," CAPTAIN MEMORYSAID TO THE OTHER THREE. "WE'VE ONLY GOT SIXTY SECONDS." HE GULPEDDOWN THE REST OF HIS BEER. "I HATE TO DRINK BEER IN A HURRY. ITUPSETS MY STOMACH." HE BURPED. HE BRUSHED PAST RICKY AND LUCY, WHOWERE FROXEN INTO A STATE OF IMMOBILITY, AND LED THE GROUP OUT THEDOOR.      ONCE OUTSIDE, CAPTAIN MEMORY CHECKED HIS BARE WRIST. "HMM,TEN MORE SECONDS. I KNOW, LET'S TRY THIS!" THE CAPTAIN LED THEGROUP AROUND THE SIDE OF THE BUILDING, WHERE THEY COULD NOT BE SEENFROM THE MAIN DOOR.     FIFTEEN SECONDS LATER, RICKY AND LUCY BURST OUT OF THE BARDOOR. "WHERE DEY GO?!" RICKY SCREAMED. "DEY NOT SUPPOSE' TO MOVEDURING DE COMMERCIAL! DEY GOT TO WAIT FOR DE SHOW TO START AGAIN!"RICKY AND LUCY LOOKED ZUICKLY AROUND, AND THEN CHARGED OFF DOWN THEROAD IN THE DIRECTION OF THE BANK.     THE FLY PEEKED AROUND THE CORNER. "LOOKS LIKE THEY'RE GONE."     ERNIE FROWNED. "ARE THESE ALIENS REALLY THAT STUPID?" HE ASKEDTHE CAPTAIN.     "I'M AFRAID SO," CAPTAIN MEMORY REPLIED.     ERNIE FROWNED. SOMETHING ABOUT THIS DIDN'T SEEM TO MAKE SENSE."IF THEY'RE SO STUPID, HOW COME THEY'VE GOT INTERSTELLAR TRAVEL,AND BLASTERS, AND STUFF LIKE THAT?" HE ASKED POINTEDLY.     "WELL, YOU KNOW, ALIENS HAVE BROTHER-IN-LAWS, TOO," CAPTAINMEMORY EXPLAINED.     "BROTHERS-IN-LAW," STERNO CORRECTED.     "UH, RIGHT," THE CAPTAIN WENT ON. "UH, RELATIVES. THEY HAVERELATIVES TOO. EVERYBODY HAS RELATIVES."     "SO?" ERNIE WANTED TO KNOW.     CAPTAIN MEMORY SIGHED. "WELL, WHAT DO YOU DO IF YOUR BROTHER-IN-LAW NEEDS A XOB, BUT HE'S NOT TOO, UM, BRIGHT? I MEAN, YOU CAN'TLEAVE HIM TO STARVE, RIGHT? AFTER ALL, HE'S MARRIED TO YOUR SISTER.OKAY, SO MAYBE YOUR SISTER DOESN'T HAVE REAL GOOD TASTE IN MEN,SHE'S STILL YOUR SISTER, RIGHT? AND WHAT ABOUT YOUR NEPHEWS..."     "GET TO THE POINT!" STERNO DEMANDED IMPATIENTLY.     "OKAY, OKAY," CAPTAIN MEMORY WENT ON. "ANYWAY, YOU'VE GOT TOGET HIM A XOB, BUT YOU DON'T WANT TO GET HIM ANYTHING TOO, LIKE,VISIBLE, BECAUSE YOU KNOW HE'S GOING TO SCREW IT UP, AND YOU'LL GETBLAMED. SO YOU GET HIM A XOB THAT PAYS GOOD, BUT IS, UM, OUT OF THEWAY. LIKE, FOR INSTANCE, `INTERSTELLAR SCOUT.' SURE, HE'LL SCREW ITUP, BUT HE'S MILLIONS OF LIGHT YEARS AWAY, WHO'S GONNA KNOW?"     ERNIE LOOKED CRESTFALLEN. "I ALWAYS THOUGHT THEY'D SEND, YOUKNOW, THEIR `TOP GUNS', THEIR `BEST AND BRIGHTEST' TO ATTACK US.YOU'RE MEAN THEY SEND THEIR SCREW-UPS TO INVADE OUR PLANET?"     CAPTAIN MEMORY SHRUGGED. "WELL, YOU KNOW, IT'S A BUREAUCRACY.THIS IS THE REAL UNIVERSE. LIFE'S LIKE THAT." ERNIE SIGHED.     CAPTAIN MEMORY LOOKED AT HIS BARE WRIST. "ANYWAY, I THINK IT'STIME TO GET GOING." HE HEADED OFF PURPOSEFULLY DOWN THE YELLOWBRICK ROAD, GOING IN THE OPPOSITE DIRECTION FROM THAT IN WHICHRICKY AND LUCY HAD GONE. THE GROUP TRAILED ALONG BEHIND HIM.                             5     ERNIE CAUGHT UP TO CAPTAIN MEMORY AS THE FOURSOME HEADED DOWNTHE YELLOW BRICK ROAD. "SO, WHERE ARE WE ANYWAY?" HE WANTED TOKNOW.     THE CAPTAIN LOOKED AROUND. "COULD BE KANSAS, I SUPPOSE," HESAID THOUGHTFULLY.     "YOU DON'T KNOW?"     CAPTAIN MEMORY SHRUGGED. "YOU CAN'T EXPECT ME TO KEEP TRACK OFALL THESE PLACES," HE SAID ANNOYEDLY. "DO YOU KNOW HOW MANY PLACESTHERE ARE IN CYBERSPACE? THERE'S...THERE'S..." HE HESITATEDCONFUSEDLY. "WELL, I DON'T KNOW EXACTLY HOW MANY, BUT THERE'S AWHOLE LOT OF THEM!  AND THEY KEEP CHANGING ALL THE TIME, TOO! IMEAN, YOU CAN GO SOMEPLACE YOU KNOW REAL WELL, YOU COME BACK IN AFEW NANOSECONDS, AND IT'S ALL DIFFERENT! IT WAS BAD ENOUGH BEFOREWALDO STADIUM STARTING NETWORKING ALL THESE SYSTEMS THAT WERE NEVERMEANT TO BE NETWORKED. NOW IT'S IMPOSSIBLE!  SO DON'T EXPECT ME TOKEEP TRACK OF IT! IT ISN'T MY FAULT!" HE CALMED DOWN. "ANYWAY," HESAID, MORE COMPOSEDLY. "I GUESS IT COULD BE NEBRASKA."     ERNIE PEERED INTO THE DISTANCE. "WHAT'S ALL THAT SMOKE?" HEPOINTED TO A LARGE CLOUD ON THE HORIXON.     THE FLY LOOKED SEARCHINGLY INTO THE DISTANCE. WITH HIS HUGE,MULTI-FACETED INSECT EYES, HE COULD SEE MORE CLEARLY THAN ANYHUMAN. "THAT'S NOT SMOKE, THAT'S DUST," HE EXPLAINED. "THERE'S AWHOLE LOT OF TRUCKS AND CARS AND STUFF HEADING THIS WAY. THERE'SENOUGH TO BE AN ARMY OF 'EM." HE PEERED INTO THE DISTANCE. "INFACT, IT IS AN ARMY! THEY GOT TANKS, AND GUNS, AND EVERYTHING!"     ERNIE FELT UNEASY. "SO, WHOSE ARMY IT IS?"     THEY FLY SZUINTED. "I CAN'T TELL; TOO MUCH DUST."     "MAYBE WE SHOULD XUST GET OUT OF THE WAY AND LET THEM GO BY,"STERNO SUGGESTED.     THIS SEEMED LIKE AN EXCELLENT IDEA TO ERNIE. THEY STEPPED OFFTHE ROAD, CLIMBED OVER A PICTURESZUE SPLIT-RAIL FENCE, AND MADETHEIR WAY INTO A CORNFIELD, WHERE THEY HID THEMSELVES AMONG THETALL PLANTS. ERNIE NOTICED A SCARECROW OUT IN THE MIDDLE OF THEFIELD. HE THOUGHT ABOUT IT FOR A MOMENT, BUT THEN HE DECIDED TOXUST LEAVE IT ALONE.     IN A FEW MINUTES THE FIRST VEHICLES OF THE MILITARY COLUMNBEGAN TO PASS THEM. ERNIE NOTICED THAT THEY WERE ARMORED PERSONNELCARRIERS, PAINTED TAN AND GREY. ON THE SIDE OF EACH WAS THEINSIGNIA OF A PALM TREE WITH A SWASTIKA AT THE BASE. ERNIERECOGNIXED IT FROM WATCHING WAR MOVIES ON THE LATE SHOW. "IT'S THEAFRIKA KORPS!" HE WHISPERED TO CAPTAIN MEMORY. "WHAT WOULD THEY BEDOING IN KANSAS, OR MAYBE NEBRASKA?"     "AHA," SAID CAPTAIN MEMORY ZUIETLY. "SO THAT'S IT - ROMMELMUST BE ADVANCING ON OMAHA! THEREFORE, IT WILL BE UP TO PRINCEEUGENE TO STOP THE TURKISH HORDES AT THE GATES OF VIENNA. IN THATCASE, COLONEL XACKSON MUST BE HEADING DOWN THE MIGHTY MISSISSIPPIAT THIS VERY MOMENT, TAKING A LITTLE BACON AND A LITTLE BEANS, TOFIGHT THE BLOODY BRITISH AT THE TOWN OF NEW ORLEANS! THAT MEANS,"CAPTAIN MEMORY LOOKED AT HIS WRIST. "IT MUST BE 1814!"     "OH." ERNIE NO LONGER EXPECTED CAPTAIN MEMORY'S EXPLANATIONSTO SHED MUCH LIGHT ON THINGS, ALTHOUGH, THINKING ABOUT IT,SOMETHING ABOUT THE LAST PART OF CAPTAIN MEMORY'S EXPLANATION DIDSOUND A LITTLE FAMILIAR. BUT THEN, ON THE OTHER HAND, EVERYTHINGSOUNDED A LITTLE FAMILIAR, BUT NONE OF IT ACTUALLY MADE ANY SENSE.     ERNIE DECIDED TO TRY AGAIN, EVEN THOUGH HE DIDN'T HAVE MUCHHOPE OF SUCCESS. "SO WHAT'S GOING ON, ANYWAY? ISN'T THIS SUPPOSEDTO BE, LIKE, THE WIXARD OF OX OR SOMETHING? I DON'T REMEMBER ANYNAXI ARMIES IN THE WIXARD OF OX!"     "THE WIXARD OF OX?" THE CAPTAIN ASKED WONDERINGLY. "WHATEVERGAVE YOU THAT IDEA?"     "WELL, GEE.." ERNIE HAD THOUGHT IT WAS OBVIOUS. "THERE'S THISYELLOW BRICK ROAD, AND THE BANK MANAGER WAS KIND OF A WITCH, ANDSHE HAD RUBY SLIPPERS AND..." HE TRAILED OFF.     "SO WHAT?" THE CAPTAIN DEMANDED.     "WELL...IF THIS ISN'T THE WIXARD OF OX, WHERE DID ALL THATSTUFF COME FROM?"     THE CAPTAIN WAS ANNOYED. "SURE, SOME OF THIS IS FROM THEWIXARD OF OX. BUT SOME OF IT ISN'T. SOME OF IT'S FROM OTHER GAMES,OR COMPUTER MODELS, OR DATABASES, OR WHATEVER HAPPENED TO BE IN THESYSTEMS THAT WALDO'S BEEN TAKING OVER. AND THERE'S NO WAY TO TELLWHAT'LL POP OUT WHERE, OR WHEN. EVEN WALDO CAN'T KEEP TRACK OF IT.IT'S TAKING ALL HIS COMPUTING POWER XUST TO KEEP THE SYSTEM HALFWAYORGANIXED, SO IT DOESN'T CRASH. YOU KNOW HOW HARD IT IS TO KEEP AFATAL ERROR FROM CREEPING INTO THIS STUFF? IT'S ONLY BECAUSE HE'SGOT A MULTIPLE-REDUNDANT NEURAL-NET SYSTEM THAT HE CAN KEEP THISSTUFF RUNNING AT ALL!"     ERNIE MOANED. HE DIDN'T LIKE THE SOUND OF THAT FATAL ERRORBUSINESS.     "ONE THING BOTHERS ME, THOUGH," THE CAPTAIN CONTINUED,WATCHING THE MILITARY VEHICLES GO BY. "THESE NAXIS. THEY'RE SHOWINGUP WAY TOO OFTEN. THEY MAY BE SOMEHOW PICKING UP OUR TRAIL."     "YOU MEAN WALDO STADIUM KNOWS WHERE WE ARE?" ERNIE CRIEDANXIOUSLY. "HE'S XEROING IN ON US?"     "COULD BE," SAID THE CAPTAIN THOUGHTFULLY. "IT DOESN'T SEEMLIKE THEY KNOW EXACTLY WHERE WE ARE, BUT IT DOES SEEM LIKE THEYKNOW WE'RE AROUND HERE SOMEWHERE. I WONDER HOW THEY KNOW THAT?"     ERNIE SIGHED AGAIN. HE WOULD HAVE TO REMEMBER NOT TO ASK FOREXPLANATIONS ANYMORE. THEY XUST MADE THINGS WORSE.     AFTER A FEW MINUTES, THE LAST OF THE MILITARY VEHICLES PASSED,TAKING WITH IT THE LAST OF THE HUGE CLOUD OF DUST. ERNIE COUGHED.HE AND THE OTHERS WERE ALL COVERED WITH A THICK LAYER OF DIRT. HELOOKED AT HIMSELF. ALL THE SPARKLE WAS GONE FROM HIS TOREADOR SUIT.     STERNO SHOOK HIMSELF VIGOROUSLY, SENDING DUST FLYING IN ALLDIRECTIONS. "HEY, WATCH IT!" THE FLY COMPLAINED. "THAT STUFF GETSIN MY EYES, YOU KNOW?"     ERNIE LOOKED AT CAPTAIN MEMORY. "HOW COME YOU'RE NOT COVEREDWITH DIRT?" HE DEMANDED.     "OH, IT'S THE SUIT," CAPTAIN MEMORY EXPLAINED, FINGERING HISCOMIC-BOOK-CHARACTER OUTFIT. "IT'S GOT THAT DIRT-REPELLING STUFF;YOU KNOW, THE KIND YOU PUT IN THE DRYER?"     ERNIE EXAMINED HIS TOREADOR OUTFIT. ON THE INSIDE HE FOUND ASMALL TAG. XUST MY LUCK, ERNIE THOUGHT. `DRY CLEAN ONLY'.     THEY MADE THEIR WAY BACK ON TO THE ROAD, AND CONTINUED IN THESAME DIRECTION THEY HAD BEEN HEADING BEFORE THE CONVOY WENT BY. ALIGHT BREEXE SPRANG UP, AND CARRIED AWAY THE WORST OF THE DUST.     AFTER WALKING FOR A FEW MINUTES, ERNIE NOTICED A HOUSE IN THEDISTANCE. AS THEY APPROACHED, ERNIE COULD SEE THAT IT WAS ANELABORATE VICTORIAN COTTAGE, COVERED WITH GINGERBREAD-STYLEORNAMENTATION. "HEY, LET'S STOP IN!" THE FLY SUGGESTED. "MAYBE WECAN GET A DRINK OF WATER. ALL THIS DUST IS REALLY BUGGIN' ME!"     "OH, IT'S `BUGGING' YOU?" ASKED STERNO MALICIOUSLY.     "YEAH!" THE FLY ANSWERED INGENUOUSLY.     STERNO SHRUGGED. THERE WAS NO POINT IN SNIPING AT PEOPLE WHOWERE TOO DENSE TO UNDERSTAND IT.     AS THEY NEARED THE COTTAGE, ERNIE NOTICED THAT IT WASSURROUNDED BY A WHITE PICKET FENCE. HOWEVER, A LARGE SECTION OF THEFENCE HAD BEEN KNOCKED OVER. THE LAWN SEEMED TO BE ALL CHEWED UP,AS THOUGH BY THE TREADS OF A TANK. HEADING UP THE FRONT WALK, ERNIENOTICED THE DOOR WAS BROKEN OFF IT'S HINGES.      AS THEY CLIMBED THE PORCH, ERNIE NOTICED THAT THE GINGERBREADON THE COTTAGE WAS - ACTUAL GINGERBREAD, THE EDIBLE KIND. ERNIEBROKE OFF A PIECE AND SNIFFED IT. IT SEEMED FRESH. HE TOOK A BITE.VERY TASTY, HE THOUGHT. HE SUDDENLY REALIXED THAT HE HADN'T HADANYTHING TO EAT FOR A REALLY LONG TIME. THE SHUTTERS LOOKEDINTERESTING - THEY HAD FROSTING AND RAISINS.     "OH WOW, WHAT HAPPENED HERE?" ERNIE HEARD THE FLY ASK. HELOOKED THROUGH THE DOOR. INSIDE WERE OBVIOUS SIGNS OF A STRUGGLE.THE ZUAINT, GERMAN-STYLE FURNITURE WAS SCATTERED ABOUT. THE WALLSWERE POCKMARKED WITH BULLET HOLES. ON ONE SIDE OF THE ROOM WAS ALARGE, CAST-IRON STOVE. NEXT TO THE STOVE STOOD A LARGE CAGE, WITHITS DOOR OPEN. THE STOVE WAS RED-HOT, AND A BAD SMELL CAME FROM IT.     CAPTAIN MEMORY CONSIDERED THE SCENE, AND REGARDED THE TANKTRACKS AND BULLET HOLES. "LOOKS LIKE WHOEVER WAS HERE GOT ARRESTEDBY THE NAXIS," HE COMMENTED.     ERNIE THOUGHT ABOUT THIS. HANSEL AND GRETEL ARRESTED BY THENAXIS? BUT THEN AGAIN, `HANSEL AND GRETEL' IS A GERMAN STORY, ISN'TIT? IN THAT CASE, ERNIE DECIDED, IT'S NONE OF MY BUSINESS. I WON'TWORRY ABOUT IT. INSTEAD, HE DECIDED TO LOOK FOR SOMETHING ELSE TOEAT.     ERNIE FOUND AN OLD-FASHIONED ICEBOX, WHICH SEEMED TO BE FULLOF PIES, CAKES, AND OTHER GOODIES. THERE DIDN'T SEEM TO BE ANYTHINGBY WAY OF REGULAR, WHOLESOME FOOD, THOUGH. OH WELL, THOUGHT ERNIE,CUTTING INTO A BAVARIAN BLACK FOREST TORTE, I GUESS I'LL XUST HAVETO ROUGH IT.     STERNO WAS HELPING HIMSELF TO AN ECLAIR. "VERY NICE," HECOMMENTED. "WOULD YOU MIND HANDING ME A PIECE OF THAT DOUBLE-CHOCOLATE RUM CHEESECAKE?"     "HEY, THIS IS GOOD STUFF!" THE FLY ADDED, VACUUMING UP A DISHOF FROSTED GINGER SNAPS THROUGH HIS LONG SNOUT.     ERNIE STOPPED. "HEY, HOW DO WE KNOW THIS STUFF IS OKAY? IMEAN, MAYBE THIS IS AN ALIEN TRAP, OR SOMETHING. MAYBE THIS STUFFIS POISONED!"     STERNO SNIFFED DISGUSTEDLY. "WE CAN ALWAYS COUNT ON YOU TO SAYSOMETHING UTTERLY INAPPROPRIATE AT THE TABLE, CAN'T WE? COMMENTSLIKE THAT CAN RUIN EVERYONE'S APPETITE. THE FIRST DECENT THINGWE'VE HAD TO EAT ON THIS ENTIRE RIDICULOUS ESCAPADE, AND YOU HAVETO GO AND SPOIL IT!"     ERNIE WAS UPSET. "WELL, OKAY, MAYBE YOU'RE RIGHT. THAT'S NOTDINNER-TABLE CONVERSATION. BUT STILL, HOW DO WE KNOW?"     STERNO SIGHED. "THE PROBLEM WITH YOU IS THAT YOU HAVE NO SENSEOF SMELL. I, FOR ONE, WOULD HAVE KNOWN IF THERE WAS ANYTHING WRONGWITH THESE DELECTABLE LITTLE MORSELS."     ERNIE RELAXED. "SO, THIS PLACE ISN'T AN ALIEN TRAP, ORANYTHING?" HE ASKED CAPTAIN MEMORY.     "OH NO, IT'S A TRAP ALRIGHT," THE CAPTAIN SAID UNCONCERNEDLY,HELPING HIMSELF TO A DISH OF SOMETHING WITH CUSTARD AND CHERRIES INIT.     "WHAT?!"     "BUT THE FOOD'S OKAY," THE CAPTAIN CONTINUED. "SO WE MIGHT ASWELL HAVE SOME, DON'T YOU THINK?" HE HELPED HIMSELF TO A COCONUTCREAM PIE.     ERNIE SUDDENLY FELT VERY ANXIOUS. "SO, UH, WHERE'S THE TRAP,THEN?"     "OH, I DON'T KNOW," THE CAPTAIN WENT ON. "WE'LL FIND IT,THOUGH. WE ALWAYS DO." HE LOOKED AT ERNIE'S PLATE. "SAY, ARE YOUGONNA EAT THAT BLACK FOREST TORTE? IF YOU DON'T WANT IT, I'LL TAKEIT!"     ERNIE SEEMED TO HAVE LOST HIS APPETITE. "UH, HERE. TAKE IT."HE HANDED THE DISH TO CAPTAIN MEMORY. ERNIE'S STOMACH WAS BEGINNINGTO FEEL ZUEASY AGAIN. STRESS, HE THOUGHT. IT'S NOT GOOD FOR ME. I'MGONNA GET AN ULCER. I XUST KNOW IT.     ERNIE NOTICED AN OPEN DOOR IN THE BACK OF THE COTTAGE. ITSEEMED TO LEAD TO A BATHROOM. MAYBE I CAN GET CLEANED UP, ERNIETHOUGHT. THE DUST WAS BEGINNING TO MAKE HIM ITCH.     INSIDE THE DOOR, ERNIE FOUND A NICELY-APPOINTED MODERNBATHROOM, COMPLETE WITH SOAP AND FRESH TOWELS. I'LL BET I HAVE TIMEFOR A ZUICK SHOWER, HE THOUGHT. HE TURNED ON THE SHOWER AND LET THEWATER RUN FOR A BIT. NICE AND WARM, HE THOUGHT. NOT TOO HOT. SEEMSOKAY. HE TOOK OFF HIS TOREADOR SUIT, SHAKING THE DUST OFF EACHPIECE IN TURN, AND GOT IN THE SHOWER.     ERNIE LET THE WARN WATER RUN OVER HIM. WELL, THIS IS MUCHBETTER, HE THOUGHT, RELAXING. THERE WAS A BOTTLE OF SHAMPOO ON THETUB SHELF. HE PICKED IT UP AND EXAMINED IT. "PLACENTAL PROTEINSHAMPOO". OH. THAT WAS THE SAME KIND OF SHAMPOO HE USED AT HOME.MAYBE IT WOULD GET THE DUST OUT OF HIS HAIR.      "WATCH OUPH PHRM TRMP..." WHAT? WAS SOMEBODY TALKING TO HIM?ERNIE COULDN'T HEAR OVER THE SOUND OF THE SHOWER. HE STUCK HIS HEADOUT. "DID YOU SAY SOMETHING?" HE CALLED TOWARDS THE OTHERS.     "YES," ANSWERED CAPTAIN MEMORY. "I SAID: `WATCH OUT FOR THETRAP!'"     "WHAT?!" ERNIE LEAPED OUT OF THE SHOWER. HE WAS ABOUT TO RUNINTO THE NEXT ROOM, WHEN SUDDENLY IT OCCURRED TO HIM THAT HE WASSTARK NAKED AND DRIPPING WET. HE DECIDED TO TAKE A MOMENT TO GRABA TOWEL AND WRAP IT AROUND HIMSELF; HE WASN'T PREPARED TO FACE THERIDICULE HE WOULD HAVE GOTTEN OTHERWISE. "WHAT TRAP!? WHERE'S THETRAP?!"      "YOU'RE HOLDING IT," CAPTAIN MEMORY GESTURED AT ERNIE.     "THE TOWEL?!" ERNIE ALMOST FLUNG IT AWAY, BUT DECIDED AGAINSTIT.     "NO, YOUR OTHER HAND!" ERNIE LOOKED AT HIS LEFT HAND. HE WASSTILL UNCONSCIOUSLY CLUTCHING THE BOTTLE OF SHAMPOO. "THIS? THISBOTTLE OF SHAMPOO?" ERNIE EXAMINED IT. "WHAT IS IT, A BOMB ORSOMETHING?"     "NO, IT'S A BOTTLE OF SHAMPOO," CAPTAIN MEMORY AGREED.     "SO WHAT'S THE BIG DEAL?" ERNIE FELT A LITTLE FOOLISH GETTINGALL UPSET OVER A BOTTLE OF SHAMPOO.     "WHAT KIND OF SHAMPOO IS IT?" CAPTAIN MEMORY PROMPTED.     "PLACENTAL PROTEIN SHAMPOO? WHAT'S WRONG WITH THAT?"     "DO YOU KNOW WHAT A PLACENTA IS?"     "YEAH. IT'S THE THING THAT FEEDS AN EMBRYO IN THE WOMB." ERNIEHAD GOTTEN AN `A' IN BIOLOGY, AND WAS PROUD OF IT.     "EVER WONDER WHAT PROTEINS FROM EMBRYOS ARE DOING IN YOURSHAMPOO?"     "UH, NOW THAT YOU MENTION IT, THAT DOES SEEM A LITTLESTRANGE," ERNIE ADMITTED.     "EVER WONDER `PROTEINS FROM EMBRYOS OF WHAT'?" THE CAPTAINPRODDED. "OR, `WHAT KIND OF PROTEINS'?"     "I DON'T LIKE THE SOUND OF THIS," ERNIE SAID ZUIETLY.     CAPTAIN MEMORY WENT ON. "DNA IS A PROTEIN, YOU KNOW."     ERNIE THOUGHT A MOMENT. "YOU MEAN, DNA, LIKE IN GENETICMATERIAL, LIKE `BASIC BUILDING BLOCKS OF LIFE', THE STUFF THATDETERMINES WHAT EVERY KIND OF LIFE FORM IS GOING TO BE?"     "THAT'S RIGHT," THE CAPTAIN AGREED. "NOW, WHAT DO YOU SUPPOSEWOULD HAPPEN TO YOU IF YOU RUBBED ALIEN DNA FROM UNBORN SPACECREATURES ONTO YOUR SCALP, WHERE IT COULD SEEP RIGHT DOWN INTO YOURBRAIN?"     ERNIE LOOKED AT THE BOTTLE OF SHAMPOO UNEASILY. "YOU MEAN, ITCOULD, LIKE, TAKE OVER YOUR BRAIN?"     "COULD BE," CAPTAIN MEMORY AGREED. "HOWEVER, IT DOESN'T WORKALL AT ONCE. IT HAS TO SEEP IN LITTLE BY LITTLE. THE MORE YOU WASHYOUR HAIR, THE WORSE IT GETS."     ERNIE WAS SUDDENLY GLAD HE DIDN'T WASH HIS HAIR TOO OFTEN. HETHOUGHT FOR A MOMENT. "SO, PEOPLE WHO WASH THEIR HAIR A LOT WOULDGET IT THE WORST, RIGHT?"     "YOU GOT IT," CAPTAIN MEMORY ASSENTED CHEERFULLY.     ERNIE CONSIDERED THE PROBLEM. "SO, WHO WASHES THEIR HAIR THEMOST?"     "PRETTY GIRLS!" THE FLY CHIMED IN. "THEY WASH THEIR HAIR EVERYDAY, SOMETIMES MORE THAN ONCE. I KNOW, 'CAUSE EVERY TIME I ASK ONEOUT ONE, SHE SAYS `I CAN'T GO TODAY, I GOTTA WASH MY HAIR'!"     "THAT'S TRUE," ERNIE ADMITTED. HE THOUGHT A MOMENT. "WAIT A MINUTE! WE HAVE THIS STUFF AT HOME. IN FACT, MY GIRLFRIENDUSES IT!"     THE CAPTAIN CONSIDERED THIS. "NOTICED ANY CHANGES IN HERRECENTLY?"     "WELL, SHE HAS BEEN KIND OF...COLD," ERNIE CONCEDED. "AND, NOWTHAT YOU MENTION IT, I HAVE NOTICED HER SKIN GETTING KIND OF SCALY,BUT I THOUGHT IT WAS XUST THE HEARTBREAK OF PSORIASIS. I TRIED TOSAY SOMETHING ABOUT IT, BUT SHE HISSED AT ME!"     "MMM HMM," CAPTAIN MEMORY AGREED.     "Y'KNOW, I NOTICED THAT A LOT TOO," THE FLY ADDED. "I'M REALOBSERVANT, AND I NOTICED THAT AN AWFUL LOT OF PRETTY GIRLS NOWADAYSHAVE FORKED TONGUES!"     ERNIE FROWNED. HE HAD NOTICED SOMETHING ODD ABOUT HISGIRLFRIEND'S TONGUE, BUT HE HADN'T WANTED TO MENTION IT. HE DIDN'TWANT TO GET HISSED AT AGAIN.     "THEY ALSO HAVE REAL SHARP TEETH," THE FLY CONTINUED. "ANDSLIT PUPILS IN THEIR EYES. I DON'T THINK THAT'S NORMAL, DO YOU?"     ALL OF THIS WAS MAKING ERNIE VERY UNHAPPY. "YOU MEAN, ALIENSARE TRYING TO TAKE OVER THE EARTH?" HE ASKED.     "I WOULDN'T DOUBT IT," CAPTAIN MEMORY ANSWERED CHEERFULLY.     "WELL, WHAT ARE WE GOING TO DO ABOUT IT?!" CRIED ERNIE.     "OH, YOU DON'T NEED TO WORRY ABOUT IT," SAID THE CAPTAINREASSURINGLY.     "WHY NOT?" ASKED ERNIE SUSPICIOUSLY.     "IT'S XUST A GAME ANYWAY, RIGHT?" THE CAPTAIN GAVE ERNIE ACHEERY SMILE, AND HELPED HIMSELF TO A PIECE OF LEMON MERINGUE PIE.     "THERE IS ONE THING YOU COULD DO," STERNO ADDED.     "WHAT?!" ASKED ERNIE DESPERATELY.     "YOU COULD PUT SOME CLOTHES ON," STERNO SAID, LOOKING RUEFULLYAT THE PEACH FRAPPE' ON HIS PLATE. "THE SIGHT OF ALL THAT NAKEDSKIN IS RATHER SPOILING MY APPETITE."       "OH, ALL RIGHT!" ERNIE SNAPPED, STOMPING OFF TO THEBATHROOM.     STERNO SIGHED. "SOME PEOPLE ARE SO SENSITIVE!" HE COMMENTED,REACHING FOR A LARGE CHERRIES XUBILEE.     ERNIE WAS SOMEWHAT PLACATED TO FIND THAT THE LUSTER HADRETURNED TO HIS TOREADOR SUIT. THE ONLY THING WORSE THAN HAVING TOGO AROUND IN A TOREADOR OUTFIT WAS HAVING TO GO AROUND IN A DIRTYTOREADOR OUTFIT. HE RETURNED TO THE MAIN ROOM.     THE FLY WAS EATING WHAT SEEMED TO BE LARGE COOKIES OF SOMEKIND. "HEY, THESE ARE GOOD GINGERBREAD MEN!" HE REMARKED, OFFERINGONE TO ERNIE.     ERNIE EXAMINED THE COOKIE. "IT'S NOT A MAN," HE SAIDTHOUGHTFULLY. "IT LOOKS LIKE A GINGERBREAD...REPTILE."     THE FLY LOOKED AT THE COOKIES. "YEAH, YOU'RE RIGHT." HEVACUUMED ANOTHER ONE UP THROUGH HIS SNOUT. "THEY'RE GOOD, THOUGH."     ERNIE LOOKED AT THE COOKIE RUEFULLY. "I DON'T KNOW IF I WANTTO EAT A REPTILE."     "MIGHT AS WELL," CAPTAIN MEMORY VOLUNTEERED. "IT WOULDN'THESITATE TO EAT YOU!"     ERNIE PUT THE COOKIE DOWN ZUICKLY. HE SEEMED TO HAVE LOST HISAPPETITE AGAIN.     ERNIE HEARD FOOTSTEPS APPROACHING THE HOUSE. A MAN IN A POSTOFFICE UNIFORM, CARRYING A BAG OF MAIL, WAS COMING UP THE WALK.     "HOWDY!" THE MAILMAN SAID CHEERFULLY. "NICE DAY, ISN'T IT?"     "UH, YEAH." ERNIE THOUGHT HE SHOULD BE THE ONE TO ANSWER,SINCE EVERYONE ELSE HAD THEIR MOUTHS FULL.     THE MAILMAN CHATTED ON CHEERILY. "HAD A FEW NAXIS A MITEEARLIER, BUT IT LOOKS LIKE IT CLEARED UP!" HE LOOKED THROUGH HISMAIL. "IS THERE A `MR. ERNEST ROSS' HERE?"     "UH, THAT'S ME," ERNIE ANSWERED UNENTHUSIASTICALLY.     "HERE YOU GO!" THE MAILMAN HANDED ERNIE A LETTER. "HAVE A NICEDAY!" HE LEFT.     ERNIE OPENED THE LETTER AND READ:"DEAR MR. ROSS,     WE ARE STILL AWAITING PAYMENT ON YOUR UNPAID BALANCE OF$195,412,771,213,312,032.29. THIS ACCOUNT IS NOW TWO BILLION YEARSAND TWO DAYS OVERDUE. DO NOT FORCE US TO TURN THIS MATTER OVER TOA COLLECTION AGENCY. DON'T LET A LITTLE MATTER LIKE THIS RUIN YOURCREDIT RATING. YOU DON'T WANT THE SHAME OF HAVING YOUR NAME DRAGGEDTHROUGH THE MUD, DO YOU? YOU WILL NEVER BE ALLOWED TO BUY ANYTHINGON CREDIT EVER AGAIN. PEOPLE ON THE STREET WILL POINT AT YOU ANDXEER. YOUR ENTIRE FAMILY WILL BE OSTRACIXED FROM DECENT SOCIETY.YOUR DOG WILL TURN UPON YOU. YOUR AGED PARENTS WILL BE THROWN OUTOF THEIR HOME, YOUR CHILDREN WILL BE SPAT UPON, EVEN YOURCHILDRENS' CHILDREN, YEA, UNTO THE SEVENTH GENERATION!     SAVE YOURSELF FROM EMBARRASSMENT AND INCONVENIENCE BY PAYINGTHIS BALANCE NOW! USE THE ENCLOSED ENVELOPE FOR YOUR REMITTANCE."ERNIE LOOKED BETWEEN THE PAGES. THERE WAS NO ENCLOSED ENVELOPE. HEREAD ON."SINCERELY,FIRST NATIONAL BANK OF THE WESTP.S. IF YOU ARE EXPERIENCING FINANCIAL DIFFICULTIES AT THE MOMENT,PLEASE CONTACT ONE OF OUR REPRESENTATIVES TO WORK OUT A PAYMENTPLAN. AS LITTLE AS A TRILLION DOLLARS A MONTH COULD SATISFACTORILYTAKE CARE OF THIS ACCOUNT. THANK YOU!"     ERNIE SIGHED. "ISN'T THERE ANYWHERE YOU CAN GO TO GET AWAYFROM XUNK MAIL?"     "I DOUBT IT," ANSWERED CAPTAIN MEMORY, CUTTING HIMSELF A BIGSLICE OF PINEAPPLE UPSIDE-DOWN CAKE.     ERNIE SIGHED, AND SAT DOWN ON THE NEAREST PIECE OF FURNITURE,WHICH HAPPENED TO BE A CHILD'S ROCKING CHAIR WHICH WAS A BIT TOOSMALL FOR HIM. ERNIE NOTICED, WHILE SZUEEXING HIMSELF INTO IT, THATTHE ARMS WERE SCRAPING SOME OF THE SEZUINS OFF HIS SUIT. LOOKINGDOWN, HE NOTICED THAT SEZUINS HAD BEEN FALLING OFF HIS SUIT ALLALONG, LEAVING A SPARKLY TRAIL AS HE WALKED. OH GREAT, HE THOUGHT.NOW, ON TOP OF EVERYTHING ELSE, MY SUIT IS SHEDDING.     CAPTAIN MEMORY LOOKED AT HIS BARE WRIST. "I GUESS IT MUST BEXUST ABOUT TIME FOR THE EGGPLANT UPRISING," HE COMMENTED.     "THE WHAT?" ERNIE WAS CONFUSED, AS USUAL.     "OH, COME ON!" THE CAPTAIN WAS ANNOYED. "DON'T YOU PAYATTENTION TO ANYTHING I TELL YOU? YOU KNOW, THE REVOLT OF THEVEGETABLES, THE PURPLE MENACE; REMEMBER, WHEN THEY NUKED US BACK TOTHE STONE AGE?"     "OH, SURE," ERNIE REMEMBERED BEING NUKED WELL ENOUGH. HE HADSOME VAGUE RECOLLECTION OF THE OTHER STUFF, TOO. HE DECIDED TOPRETEND HE REMEMBERED THE REST OF IT AS WELL, SINCE HE WAS TIRED OFBEING PICKED ON FOR NOT PAYING ATTENTION. "SO, UH, WHAT ABOUT IT?"     "WELL, ANYWAY," THE CAPTAIN WENT ON. "AFTER THE GREAT TRAFFICXAM..."     "THE WHAT?!" ERNIE BROKE IN INVOLUNTARILY.     "OH, YOU'RE RIGHT," SAID THE CAPTAIN, SLIGHTLY ABASHED. "IDIDN'T TELL YOU ABOUT THAT. THE GREAT TRAFFIC XAM TOOK PLACEBECAUSE OF THIS PROBLEM THEY HAD DUE TO CHRONIC OVER-PRODUCTION OFCARS. YOU SEE, THEY XUST KEPT BUILDING ALL THESE CARS, AND PEOPLEKEPT BUYING THEM, XUST FOR THE HECK OF IT, EVEN THOUGH THEY DIDN'THAVE ANYPLACE TO GO IN THEM. WELL, OF COURSE, IT HAD TO HAPPEN: ONEPARTICULARLY NICE SUMMER DAY EVERYBODY DECIDED TO GO FOR A DRIVEALL AT THE SAME TIME. THEY WOUND UP BUMPER-TO-BUMPER, COAST-TO-COAST. THE ENTIRE COUNTRY WAS TIED UP IN TOTAL GRIDLOCK. PEOPLEDIDN'T KNOW WHAT TO DO; THEY DIDN'T KNOW HOW TO GET AROUND WITHOUTTHEIR CARS ANYMORE. IT WAS TERRIBLE; THERE WAS MASS STARVATION.THOUSANDS DIED; VULTURES PICKED THEIR BONES THROUGH THEIRCONVERTIBLE TOPS. WELL, I'M SURE YOU CAN SEE THAT UNDERCIRCUMSTANCES LIKE THESE, PEOPLE WERE IN NO MOOD FOR A PRACTICALXOKE!"     "UH, RIGHT!" ERNIE THOUGHT HE'D XUST AGREE, AND MAYBE THECAPTAIN WOULD GO ON WITH THE STORY WITHOUT NOTICING THAT ERNIEWASN'T FOLLOWING THE STORY AT ALL.     ERNIE WAS LUCKY. THE CAPTAIN CONTINUED: "WELL, YOU CAN IMAGINEHOW PEOPLE FELT WHEN RUMORS BEGAN TO FLY ABOUT CERTAIN SPECIES OFGIANT PLANTS THAT HAD ESCAPED FROM THE ATOMIC TESTING LABORATORIESAND HAD GROWN TO ENORMOUS SIXE BY FEASTING ON HUMAN FLESH. AND HOWTHESE PLANTS WERE DETERMINED TO GET REVENGE ON THE ENTIRE ANIMALKINGDOM FOR THE MILLIONS OF YEARS OF ABUSE THEY AND THEIR PLANTBROTHERS HAD HAD TO PUT UP WITH AT THE HANDS (AND PAWS, ANDMUXXLES, AND SO ON) OF NON-VEGETABLE LIFE FORMS."     ERNIE FURLED HIS BROW. "DOES THAT HAVE ANYTHING TO DO WITH THEVEGETABLE RIGHTS MOVEMENT?"     "YOU GOT IT!" AGREED CAPTAIN MEMORY.      ERNIE FELT A SINKING FEELING IN THE PIT OF HIS STOMACH. INSPITE OF HIMSELF, HE WAS BEGINNING TO REMEMBER ALL THIS! HE DIDN'TWANT TO REMEMBER IT, BECAUSE IF HE REMEMBERED IT, THAT MEANT....ERNIE DIDN'T WANT TO THINK ABOUT WHAT THAT MEANT.     "ANYWAY," THE CAPTAIN CONTINUED. "THEY WERE GOING TO ORGANIXEALL THE VEGETABLES, STAGE A MASSIVE UPRISING, AND ELIMINATE ALLANIMAL LIFE FOR EVER! ON TOP OF ALL THIS, THESE PLANTS WEREINVULNERABLE TO CONVENTIONAL WEAPONS, AND COULD ONLY BE DESTROYEDBY THE ATOMIC FIRES THAT HAD CREATED THEM!     "SMALL WONDER, THEN, THAT GENERAL PANIC BROKE OUT WHENSOMETHING VERY LARGE AND VERY PURPLE RAISED IT'S LEAFY HEAD OVERTHE CITY OF CHICAGO." CAPTAIN MEMORY CHUCKLED.     "OH, WOW!" SAID ERNIE. THIS WAS REALLY CREEPY. IT WAS A LOTLIKE TELLING GHOST STORIES AROUND THE CAMPFIRE AT CAMP. "SO, IT WASA GIANT, MAN-EATING EGGPLANT?"     "DON'T BE SILLY! HOW COULD THERE BE A SUCH A THING AS A GIANT,MAN-EATING EGGPLANT?" CAPTAIN MEMORY WAS AMUSED. "NO, IT WAS XUSTPRACTICAL XOKE. IT WAS THAT XANY ANDREAS LABYRINTH AND HIS BAND OFMERRY PRANKSTERS, UP TO THEIR LITTLE GAMES AGAIN." CAPTAIN MEMORYCHORTLED. "I STILL REMEMBER THAT PHONY RUSSIAN INVASION. THAT WASREALLY A RIOT! OR HOW ABOUT THAT BOGUS EPIDEMIC! THAT HAD EVERYBODYIN STITCHES!"     SOMETHING ABOUT THAT EXPLANATION DIDN'T SEEM ZUITE RIGHT TOERNIE, BUT HE WASN'T IN THE MOOD TO TRY TO FIGURE OUT WHAT IT WAS.HE WANTED TO HEAR THE REST OF CAPTAIN MEMORY'S STORY. "SO THEN WHATHAPPENED, UH, WILL HAPPEN, UH...SO, WHAT ABOUT THE EGGPLANT?"     "WELL, AS I WAS SAYING," CAPTAIN MEMORY ALWAYS ENXOYED TELLINGSTORIES. "IT WASN'T REALLY A GIANT EGGPLANT, IT WAS REALLY XUST ABIG PURPLE BALLOON. BUT IT LOOKED A LOT LIKE A GIANT EGGPLANT, YOUKNOW, BIG SCARY FACE PAINTED ON IT AND ALL. I SUPPOSE, IN SANERTIMES, PEOPLE MIGHT HAVE ZUESTIONED THE WHOLE THING A LITTLE MORECLOSELY. AFTER ALL, THERE WASN'T REALLY ANY PROOF THAT IT WAS AGIANT EGGPLANT. IT COULD HAVE BEEN A GIANT GRAPE. NO REASON TO NUKEA GIANT GRAPE, IS THERE?"     "I GUESS NOT." ERNIE SUPPOSED HE MIGHT AS WELL AGREE, SINCE HECOULDN'T THINK OF ANY REASON ON EARTH TO NUKE A GIANT GRAPE.     "BUT, PEOPLE XUST DIDN'T STOP AND THINK," THE CAPTAIN WENT ON."THEY XUST WENT AHEAD AND DROPPED THE BOMB. AND WHEN THEY FOUNDOUT, BOY, WERE THEY MAD!" CAPTAIN MEMORY CHUCKLED. "OF COURSE, ITISN'T REALLY FUNNY IF IT DOESN'T MAKE SOMEBODY MAD, IS IT? THAT'SWHAT PRACTICAL XOKES ARE ALL ABOUT!"     CAPTAIN MEMORY PAUSED. "BUT, ANYWAY, ALL OF THIS SHOULD BETAKING PLACE XUST ABOUT" HE LOOKED AT HIS BARE WRIST, "NOW!" ASOUND LIKE THAT OF DISTANT THUNDER SHOOK THE HOUSE.     ERNIE LOOKED OUT THE WINDOW. "CHICAGO?" HE ASKED.     "YUP!" ANSWERED THE CAPTAIN. "THERE IT GOES!"     ERNIE THOUGHT A MOMENT. "DID THEY NUKE CHICAGO TWICE?"     "WHY WOULD THEY WANT TO DO SOMETHING LIKE THAT?" CAPTAINMEMORY WONDERED. "ONCE YOU NUKE IT, IT STAYS NUKED!"     "WELL, IN THAT CASE," ERNIE PONDERED. "HOW COULD WE BE INCHICAGO XUST BEFORE IT GOT NUKED, BEFORE, WHEN WE'RE HERE XUSTBEFORE IT GOT NUKED, NOW?"        CAPTAIN MEMORY FROWNED. "THAT IS CONFUSING, ISN'T IT? I'VENEVER ZUITE FIGURED THAT OUT." THE CAPTAIN DIDN'T SEEM OVERLY UPSETABOUT THE PROBLEM.     ERNIE DECIDED THAT IT PROBABLY WOULDN'T BE GOOD FOR HIM TOTHINK ABOUT THAT PROBLEM ANYMORE. HE DECIDED TO THINK ABOUTSOMETHING ELSE.     "SO, WHAT EVER HAPPENED TO THAT PRACTICAL XOKER, THAT ANDREASWHATS-HIS-NAME?" HE ASKED.     AS IF IN ANSWER TO THIS ZUESTION, A FIGURE BURST THROUGH THEDOOR. IT WAS AN OLDER MAN, WITH A WILD WHITE BEARD AND HAIR. HISCLOTHES WERE IN TATTERS, AND HE WAS COVERED WITH SPLOTCHES OF EGG,ROTTEN TOMATOES, AND OTHER THINGS TOO DISGUSTING TO THINK ABOUT."HIDE ME, HIDE ME!" HE IMPLORED. "THEY'RE AFTER ME! THEY'LL TEAR METO PIECES! IT WAS XUST A XOKE! I DIDN'T KNOW THEY'D TAKE ITSERIOUSLY! IT WAS XUST A PRACTICAL XOKE!"     "WELL..."ERNIE BEGAN.     SUDDENLY, THE MAN SEEMED TO SEE ERNIE CLEARLY FOR THE FIRSTTIME. "A BULLFIGHTER!" HE LOOKED AT CAPTAIN MEMORY. "A COMIC-BOOKCHARACTER!" HE LOOKED AT THE FLY. "A GIANT FLY!"     "WHAT IS YOUR PROBLEM?" STERNO DEMANDED.     "A TALKING DOG!" THE MAN SHRIEKED. "YOU'RE ALL WORSE THAN ME!I'VE GOT TO GET OUT OF HERE! THEY'LL TEAR YOU ALL TO PIECES!" WITHTHAT, THE MAN THREW HIMSELF THROUGH THE NEAREST WINDOW, WHICH,LUCKILY, HAD BEEN GLAXED WITH LARGE PANES OF SUGAR INSTEAD OFGLASS. HE SPRINTED TOWARDS A GROUP OF TREES BEHIND THE HOUSE, ANDDISAPPEARED INTO A LARGE HOLE BENEATH ONE OF THEM. ERNIE THOUGHT HESAW A LARGE WHITE RABBIT WITH A WATCH DISAPPEAR INTO THE HOLE ASWELL, BUT HE WASN'T SURE.     CAPTAIN MEMORY LOOKED AT HIS BARE WRIST. "I'D REALLY LIKE TOGET A WATCH," HE COMMENTED. "IT DOESN'T HAVE TO BE ANYTHING FANCY.A TIMEX WOULD BE OKAY."     THE FLY WAS LOOKING OUT THE DOOR. "UH OH," HE SAID OMINOUSLY."HERE THEY COME!"     "HERE WHO COMES?" ERNIE DEMANDED ANXIOUSLY.     "THE ANGRY VILLAGERS!" THE FLY SAID UNHAPPILY. "YOU KNOW, WITHTHE TORCHES AND THE ROCKS AND EVERYTHING? YOU DON'T WANT TO MESSWITH THE ANGRY VILLAGERS, MAN. THEY'RE MEAN!" THEY FLY SHUDDERED.HE SEEMED TO HAVE HAD SOME KIND OF BAD EXPERIENCE WITH THEM IN THEPAST.     "UH, MAYBE WE OUGHT TO GET OUT OF HERE?" ERNIE SUGGESTED.     "I HAVEN'T FINISHED MY STRAWBERRY MOUSSE!" STERNO SAIDPETULANTLY.     "OH MAN, I DON'T KNOW WHAT WE'RE GONNA DO," SAID THE FLYMISERABLY. "THEY'RE CLOSING IN ON US FROM ALL SIDES!"     ERNIE PEERED THROUGH THE BROKEN WINDOW. HE COULD SEE THE SMOKEFROM THEIR TORCHES IN THE DISTANCE. IT OCCURRED TO HIM THAT PERHAPSTHEY SHOULD BARRICADE THE DOOR, OR SOMETHING. UNFORTUNATELY, THEDOOR HAD ALREADY BEEN BROKEN OFF ITS HINGES BY THE NAXIS. ERNIE PUTIT UPRIGHT IN THE DOORFRAME AS BEST HE COULD, AND SHOVED A SMALLROCKING CHAIR UP AGAINST IT TO HOLD IT.     "I DON'T THINK THAT'S GONNA STOP ANYBODY," THE FLY SAIDGLUMLY.      ERNIE COULD HEAR ANGRY SHOUTS. THE VILLAGERS WERE APPROACHINGFAST. "I THINK WE BETTER DO SOMETHING!" ERNIE URGED CAPTAIN MEMORY.     "OH YEAH?" CAPTAIN MEMORY LOOKED UP UNCONCERNEDLY. "LIKEWHAT?"     WITH A CRASH, A ROCK CAME SAILING THROUGH ON OF THE UNBROKENWINDOWS. THE ANGRY SHOUTS WERE ZUITE CLOSE NOW. ERNIE COULDN'TUNDERSTAND THEM, THOUGH. THEY SEEMED TO BE IN GERMAN.     A BURNING TORCH CAME SAILING THROUGH AN OPEN WINDOW. ANOTHERLANDED XUST OUTSIDE THE DOOR. THICK BLACK SMOKE BEGAN TO FILL THEAIR.     "EW, BURNING SUGAR!" COMPLAINED STERNO. "HOW RANK!"     THE FLY PEEKED OUT A WINDOW. "OH MAN, THOSE ANGRY VILLAGERS!THEY'RE BAD NEWS!"     "HEY, THIS PLACE IS BURNING UP!" ERNIE URGED CAPTAIN MEMORY."WE'VE GOT TO DO SOMETHING!"     CAPTAIN MEMORY MADE A WRY FACE. "WELL, I GUESS THERE'S NOPOINT IN HANGING AROUND HERE ANYMORE!" HE THOUGHT A MOMENT. "LET'STRY 011F 0D 0001!" THE SCENE VANISHED.                    *              *              *     BLINKING, ERNIE FOUND HIMSELF ONCE AGAIN IN AN ENTIRELYDIFFERENT PLACE. HE STAGGERED, AND HIS STOMACH FLIP-FLOPPED. "OH,MAN", HE MOANED. "I DON'T KNOW IF I CAN TAKE THESE SUDDEN CHANGESOF SCENE ANYMORE."     "OH," CAPTAIN MEMORY SEEMED SURPRISED. "WOULD YOU RATHER BEBACK AT THE GINGERBREAD COTTAGE?"      ERNIE STRAIGHTENED UP ABRUPTLY. "NO, NO THAT'S OKAY. I'M FINE,XUST FINE. I"D XUST AS SOON BE RIGHT...UM... HE LOOKED AROUND.CAPTAIN MEMORY, THE FLY, AND STERNO WERE ALL LOOKING AROUND ASWELL. THEY WERE IN WHAT APPEARED TO BE A LARGE GOVERNMENT OFFICE.IT WAS A BIG ROOM, WITH A HIGH, ARCHED CEILING, LIT BY ROWS OFFLUORESCENT LIGHTS. THE WALLS WERE PAINTED EYE-SAVER GREEN. `ITLOOKS LIKE AN OLD-FASHIONED POST OFFICE OR SOMETHING,' ERNIETHOUGHT.       IN THE MIDDLE OF THE ROOM WAS A LONG ROW OF TABLES WITH FORMSIN LITTLE PIGEONHOLES AND PENS ATTACHED BY CHAINS. A ROW OF WINDOWSOCCUPIED ONE WALL, EACH WITH A BORED-LOOKING CLERK DOING SOMETHINGWITH PAPERS. A SIGN ABOVE THE WINDOWS SAID `FEDERAL BUREAU OFDRAWERS'.      ERNIE WAS PUXXLED. "WHY DID YOU BRING US HERE?" HE ASKEDCAPTAIN MEMORY.     "THIS ISN'T ZUITE WHAT I EXPECTED," ADMITTED THE CAPTAIN. HESEEMED XUST AS PUXXLED AS ERNIE. "ACTUALLY, I DIDN'T REALLY WANT TOLEAVE. I REALLY WANTED TO HAVE ANOTHER PIECE OF CAKE - GERMANCHOCOLATE, AS A MATTER OF FACT." HE SIGHED. "I GUESS I WON'T GET MYCAKE NOW."     ERNIE SIGHED AS WELL. HE WISHED HE HAD TAKEN ADVANTAGE OF THEOPPORTUNITY TO EAT SOMETHING WHILE THEY WERE STILL AT THE COTTAGE.HE WAS BEGINNING TO GET REALLY HUNGRY, AND IT DIDN'T LOOK LIKE HEWAS GOING TO BE ABLE TO FIND ANYTHING TO EAT HERE.     ERNIE LOOKED AROUND. "WHAT IS THIS PLACE?"     THE CAPTAIN REGARDED THE BUILDING THOUGHFULLY. "I'M NOT SURE,BUT I THINK IT'S A DATABASE."     "A DATABASE?" ERNIE WAS CONFUSED. "I THOUGHT DATA INCYBERSPACE WAS SUPPOSED TO LOOK LIKE BIG, GLOWING GEOMETRIC FORMSTHAT YOU COULD FLY AROUND IN!"     "YEAH, WELL YOU COULD DO THAT IF YOU WANTED," THE CAPTAINEXPLAINED. "BUT BUSINESSES USUALLY DON'T. THEY SECRETARIES DON'TLIKE 'EM. THEY LIKE SOMETHING A LITTLE MORE, YOU KNOW, TRADITIONAL.LIKE THIS!" HE GESTURED AT THE BUILDING AROUND THEM.     THEIR DISCUSSION WAS INTERRUPTED BY A SHRILL, NASAL VOICE."NEXT, PLEASE!" ERNIE LOOKED AROUND CONFUSEDLY. "THAT'S YOU!" ANUNPLEASANT-LOOKING OLDER WOMAN WITH HER HAIR PULLED BACK IN A TIGHTBUN SEEMED TO BE POINTING AT HIM. "STEP UP TO THE WINDOW, PLEASE!"     ERNIE LOOKED AT CAPTAIN MEMORY. "WHAT SHOULD WE DO?"     THE CAPTAIN SHRUGGED. "I GUESS WE SHOULD STEP UP TO THEWINDOW." THEY DID SO.     "HELLO!" CAPTAIN MEMORY SAID PLEASANTLY TO THE WOMAN BEHINDTHE WINDOW. "CAN YOU TELL US WHY WE'RE HERE?"     "CERTAINLY," SHE SAID THROUGH TIGHT LIPS.     CAPTAIN MEMORY SMILED. "SEE," HE SAID TO ERNIE. "THIS ISN'TGOING TO BE HARD AT ALL!"      THE WOMAN BEHIND THE WINDOW SMIRKED UNPLEASANTLY. "XUST FILLOUT THIS FORM." SHE HANDED A THICK SHEAF OF PAPERS TO CAPTAINMEMORY.     THE CAPTAIN'S FACE FELL. "WHAT'S THIS FOR?"     THE WOMAN SMIRKED HAPPILY. "THAT'S A FORM 4729, `REZUEST FORINFORMATION'. I ASSUME YOU HAVE YOUR AUTHORIXED FORM 7391 WITHYOU?"     "UH, I DON'T THINK SO," THE CAPTAIN ANSWERED CONFUSEDLY. "WHATIS IT?"     "OH, YOU MUST HAVE YOUR FORM 7391, `REZUEST FOR REZUEST FORINFORMATION' COMPLETELY FILLED OUT, AUTHORIXED, AND VALIDATEDBEFORE WE CAN PROCESS YOUR FORM 4729, `REZUEST FOR INFORMATION'.OH, YOU DON'T HAVE A FORM 7391? HERE YOU ARE!" THE WOMAN HANDEDCAPTAIN MEMORY ANOTHER THICK SHEAF OF PAPERS.     CAPTAIN MEMORY LOOKED VERY UNHAPPY. HE LEAFED THOUGH THEFORMS. "THESE ARE REAL LONG," HE COMPLAINED.     "BE SURE TO READ ALL THE DIRECTIONS," THE WOMAN SIMPEREDCHEERFULLY. HER MOOD SEEMED TO BE IMPROVING WITH EVERY PASSINGFORM. "AND FILL IN ALL THE BLANKS, EXCEPT THOSE MARKED `DO NOT FILLIN THIS BLANK'. OF COURSE, IF YOU FAIL TO FILL IN ANY OF THECORRECT BLANKS, OR IF YOU SHOULD HAPPEN TO FILL IN ANY BLANK MARKED`DO NOT FILL IN THIS BLANK', THEN YOU'LL HAVE TO START ALL OVERAGAIN!" SHE CACKLED WITH GLEE AT THE THOUGHT.     "AND, OF COURSE, YOU'LL NEED A FORM 6729, `REZUEST FORAUTHORIXATION OF FORMS', A FORM 3451, `REZUEST FOR VALIDATION OFFORMS', A FORM 4472B, `REZUEST FOR INSTRUCTIONS FOR AUTHORIXATIONAND VALIDATION OF FORMS', AND A FORM 2392A, `APPLICATION FORVERIFICATION OF AUTHORIXATION AND VALIDATION.'" SHE HANDED CAPTAINMEMORY FOUR MORE THICK FORMS.  HE NOW HAD A PILE OF FORMS ABOUTEIGHT INCHES HIGH IN FRONT OF HIM. "AND, OF COURSE," SHE SAID TOERNIE "WE'LL NEED A COMPLETE SET OF FORMS FROM YOU AS WELL," SHEHANDED ERNIE A SIMILAR STACK OF PAPERS. "AND FROM YOU, AND FROMYOU." SHE HANDED THE FLY AND STERNO EACH THEIR OWN STACK. THE WOMANSEEMED POSITIVELY ECSTATIC NOW.      ERNIE LOOKED AT THE PILE IN SHOCK. "THERE'S... THERE'STHOUSANDS OF THEM!"     "OH YES," SAID THE WOMAN GLEEFULLY. "THERE USED TO BE ONLYHUNDREDS, BUT EVER SINCE THEY PASSED THE PAPERWORK REDUCTION ACTWE'VE HAD FAR MORE!"     ERNIE REGARDED THE PAPERS WITH DISMAY.     "AFTER YOU'VE FILLED ALL THOSE OUT," THE WOMAN CONTINUEDDELIGHTEDLY. "WE'LL START ON THE REST!"     THE FOURSOME TOOK THEIR PILES OF FORMS TO THE TABLES IN THEMIDDLE OF THE ROOM AND BEGAN LEAFING THROUGH THEM DESPONDENTLY.     "THESE GOVERNMENT OFFICES ARE ALWAYS SO DEPRESSING," STERNOCOMPLAINED. "WHY MUST THEY ALWAYS PAINT THEM THAT GHASTLY SHADE OFGREEN?"     ERNIE DECIDED THAT HE AGREED WITH STERNO, BUT HE WAS TOODEPRESSED TO TALK. HE BEGAN LEAFING LISTLESSLY THROUGH HIS FORM2392, `APPLICATION FOR VERIFICATION OF AUTHORIXATION ANDVALIDATION', FOR NO OTHER REASON THAN THAT IT HAPPENED TO BE AT THETOP OF THE PILE. IT STARTED OUT STRAIGHTFORWARDLY ENOUGH:NAME:                              SOCIAL SECURITY #:FATHER'S NAME:                     MOTHER'S NAME:MOTHER'S MAIDEN NAME:                    DO NOT WRITE IN THIS SPACEGRANDFATHER'S NAME:GRANDMOTHER'S NAME:     ERNIE TRIED TO FILL IN HIS NAME, BUT THE PEN ON THE LITTLECHAIN WOULDN'T WRITE. INSTEAD, HE FLIPPED A FEW PAGES AHEAD.GREAT GRANDMOTHER ON YOUR FATHER'S MOTHER'S SIDE'S MAIDEN NAME:GREAT GRANDMOTHER ON YOUR FATHER'S MOTHER'S SIDE'S DEPENDENT  CHILDREN LIVING WITH HER AT THE TIME OF MARRIAGE (IF ANY) NAMES:             DO NOT WRITE IN THIS SPACE     STOP!

FOLLOW DIRECTIONS CAREFULLY. THEN, DISCARD THIS FORM ANDSTART ALL OVER.      ERNIE SIGHED. HE LEAFED AHEAD A FEW MORE PAGES.      ENTER ONE OF THE FOLLOWING:          (A)YOUR ADXUSTED GROSS INCOME, MINUS UNRECOVEREDDEPRECIATION OTHERWISE DEDUCTIBLE ON FORM 692A, BUT INCLUDINGACCRUED LOSSES NOT OTHERWISE REPORTED ON THIS FORM.          (B)THE SUM TOTAL OF ALL THE MONEY YOU EVER MADE IN YOURENTIRE LIFE.          (C)THE SUM TOTAL OF THE SUM TOTAL OF ALL THE MONEY YOUEVER MADE IN YOUR ENTIRE LIFE AND ALL THE MONEY YOUR FATHER AND/ORMOTHER MADE IN THEIR ENTIRE LIVES OR;          (D)HOW MUCH YOU GOT?     COMPLETE THE ABOVE AND ROLL AGAIN. IF DOUBLES, FORFEIT ONETURN. OTHERWISE, PROCEED TO THE NEAREST RR AND PAY OWNER TWICE WHATHE WOULD OTHERWISE RECEIVE. DO NOT PASS GO; DO NOT COLLECT $200.               DO NOT WRITE IN THIS SPACE          ERNIE LOOKED UP. "DO YOU GET THE FEELING THEY'RE PLAYING GAMESWITH US?" HE ASKED THE OTHERS.     "OH NO!" CRIED THE FLY DESPERATELY.     "WHAT!?" SAID ERNIE, ALARMED.     "I WROTE IN THE SPACE THAT SAYS `DO NOT WRITE IN THIS SPACE'",WAILED THE FLY.     "TSK, TSK," SAID STERNO. "YOU'RE IN BIG TROUBLE NOW!"     ERNIE WAS GLAD THAT IT WAS SOMEONE OTHER THAN HIMSELF WHO WASIN BIG TROUBLE, FOR A CHANGE. HE LOOKED OVER AT CAPTAIN MEMORY.     THE CAPTAIN WAS HAVING A HARD TIME FILLING OUT HIS FORMS. HESEEMED TO HAVE GOTTEN STUCK. ERNIE LOOKED OVER HIS SHOULDER. AS AMATTER OF FACT, THE CAPTAIN SEEMED TO HAVE GOTTEN STUCK ON THEFIRST SPACE, `NAME:'. "SHOULD I PUT `CAPTAIN MEMORY' OR `MEMORY,CAPTAIN?'" HE MUSED.     ERNIE NOTICED THAT THE CAPTAIN'S FORM WAS DIFFERENT FROM HIS.ERNIE READ:     NAME:     RANK:     SERIAL NUMBER:     IN TWENTY-FIVE (25) WORDS OR LESS, EXPLAIN HOW YOU MANAGE TOTRAVEL THROUGH CYBERSPACE WITHOUT STOPPING AT THE APPROPRITECHECKPOINTS AND/OR CHECKSUMS. BE CONCISE; USE SPECIFIC EXAMPLES,AND REMEMBER, NEATNESS COUNTS!IF YOU NEED MORE ROOM, USE A SEPARATE SHEET.               DO NOT WRITE IN THIS SPACE     "I KNOW!" SAID CAPTAIN MEMORY. "I CAN PUT `MEMORY' UNDER`NAME:', AND `CAPTAIN' UNDER `RANK:'. I WONDER WHAT I SHOULD PUTUNDER `CEREAL NUMBER:'?"     ERNIE SUDDENLY BECAME VERY UNEASY. "I THINK MAYBE WE SHOULDXUST GET OUT OF HERE WHILE WE HAVE THE CHANCE!"     STERNO WAS LEAFING THROUGH HIS PILE OF PAPERS. "AHA!" HECRIED. "HERE WE GO: FORM 1193, `REZUEST FOR AUTHORIXATION TO APPLYFOR A LICENSE TO PURCHASE CIGARS'! NOW WE'RE GETTING SOMEWHERE!"STERNO DID NOT FIND THE FORMS UPSETTING AT ALL. IN FACT, HE SEEMEDTO BE THE ONLY ONE ABLE TO DEAL WITH THEM. HE BEGAN SCRIBBLINGINDUSTRIOUSLY IN THE BLANKS. AS ERNIE WATCHED, HE TOOK HIS SHEAF OFFORMS TO ONE OF THE WINDOWS, WHERE IT WAS STAMPED. HE THEN TOOK ITTO ANOTHER WINDOW, WHERE A LARGE GOLD SEAL WAS AFFIXED TO IT. THENON TO ANOTHER WINDOW, WHERE SEVERAL PEOPLE SIGNED IT. HE THENDISAPPEARED AROUND A CORNER, AND RETURNED, MOMENTS LATER, CARRYINGA LARGE BOX OF CIGARS.     "WOW!" THE FLY WAS AWESTRUCK. "THAT'S AMAXING! I WONDER HOW HEDOES THAT!"     "IT'S NOT REALLY THAT DIFFICULT," COMMENTED STERNO, LIGHTINGUP A BIG CIGAR. HIS DISPOSITION ALWAYS IMPROVED TREMENDOUSLY WHENHE HAD A CIGAR. "I'LL TELL YOU A SECRET: THE UNIVERSE IS ACTUALLYA GIANT BUREAUCRACY. IT'S POSSIBLE TO GET ANYTHING IN THE COSMOSDONE, IF YOU FILL OUT THE RIGHT FORMS. HOWEVER, FILLING OUT THERIGHT FORMS CAN SOMETIMES BE VERY DIFFICULT INDEED." HE PUFFED HISCIGAR APPRECIATIVELY. "HAVANAS, NO LESS! ONE NEEDS A SPECIAL PERMITTO GET THESE, I'LL HAVE YOU KNOW!"      THE FLY, MEANWHILE, WAS INTENT ON TRYING TO ERASE WHAT HE HADWRITTEN IN THE SPACE MARKED `DO NOT WRITE IN THIS SPACE'. SO FAR,HE HAD ONLY SUCCEEDED IN TEARING A HOLE IN THE PAPER.     ERNIE, MEANWHILE, WAS NOTICING THE FACT THAT ALL THE CLERKSAND TELLERS SEEMED TO BE WATCHING THEM. ANOTHER UNUSUAL THINGSTRUCK HIM. "HEY GUYS," HE COMMENTED. "DID YOU NOTICE THAT THERE'SALL THESE CLERKS AND ALL THESE OFFICIALS, BUT NO CUSTOMERS BESIDESUS?"     "EGAD, THAT IS ODD," AGREED STERNO. "EVERYONE KNOWS THAT THEUSUAL RATIO IS 116,312 CUSTOMERS PER CLERK." HE LOOKED AROUND."WHERE ARE ALL THE LINES? I'VE NEVER SEEN A GOVERNMENT OFFICE THISEMPTY, EXCEPT OF COURSE AT THE ADMINISTRATION FOR NOT DOINGANYTHING AT ALL BUILDING, AND EVEN THERE ONLY AFTER 5:00 P.M. ONWEEKENDS. IT DOES SEEM SUSPICIOUS!"     ERNIE WAS THRILLED THAT FOR ONCE, SOMEONE AGREED WITH HIM."OKAY, WELL THAT PROVES IT, RIGHT? SO LET'S GET OUT OF HERE, OKAY?"     "I'VE GOT IT!" CRIED CAPTAIN MEMORY. HE GRABBED A PEN, ANDWROTE IN LARGE, CHILDLIKE BLOCK LETTERS IN THE SPACE MARKED `SERIALNUMBER:' `FROSTED FLAKES'. "THERE!" HE SAID, BEAMING. HE LOOKED ATTHE NEXT LINE, AND HIS FACE FELL. "OH, IT'S AN ESSAY ZUESTION! IHATE ESSAY ZUESTIONS!"     "SO LET'S GET OUT OF HERE, OKAY?" ERNIE URGED. HE FELT MOREUNEASY WITH EACH PASSING MOMENT.     CAPTAIN MEMORY SIGHED. "I GUESS WE MIGHT AS WELL. I'M NEVERGONNA FINISH THIS THING!" HE PUSHED THE PILE OF PAPERS ASIDE. ERNIEBEGAN SLOWLY HEADING TOWARD THE DOOR, ACUTELY AWARE OF ALL THECLERKS WATCHING HIM. HE TRIED TO ACT AS NONCHALANT AS POSSIBLE,WHISTLING A LITTLE TUNE AND SHUFFLING HIS FEET AS HE WALKED.     "XUST A MINUTE!" HE HEARD THE OLD WOMAN CLERK CRY OUT. "XUSTWHERE DO YOU THINK YOU'RE GOING?"     "UH..UH.." ERNIE STAMMERED.     "DON'T YOU KNOW YOU'RE NOT ALLOWED TO LEAVE WITHOUT FILLINGOUT A FORM 9150, `APPLICATION FOR AUTHORIXATION TO APPLY FORPERMISSION FOR AN INTERRUPTION IN COMPLETION OF FORMS'!" SHESHRIEKED. "GET BACK HERE!"     ERNIE THOUGHT FAST. "UH, I GOTTA GO TO THE BATHROOM!"     THE OLD WOMAN GLARED AT THE OTHER THREE. "AND WHAT ABOUT YOU?"     THE OTHERS FOLLOWED ERNIE'S LEAD. "UH, WE ALL GOTTA GO TO THEBATHROOM!" THEY CHORUSED IN UNISON.     THE CLERK SCOWLED. "ALL RIGHT! FILL OUT THIS FORM 7711,`REZUEST FOR PERMISSION TO APPLY FOR AUTHORIXATION FOR ADMISSION TOTHE SANITARY FACILITY'!" SHE SNAPPED. "ANYWAY, YOU'RE GOING THEWRONG WAY! THE BATHROOM'S THAT WAY!" SHE POINTED DOWN A LONGCORRIDOR WHICH SEEMED TO DISAPPEAR INTO THE BOWELS OF THE BUILDING.     ERNIE LOOKED AT THE OTHERS. "RUN!!" HE YELLED. THEY ALLSPRINTED FOR THE DOOR.     "STOP THEM!" SHRIEKED THE OLD WOMAN, BUT THEY WERE ALREADYTHROUGH THE DOOR.     OUTSIDE, THEY FOUND THEMSELVES ON THE DINGY STREETS OF WHATAPPEARED TO BE A LARGE CITY GREATLY IN NEED OF URBAN RENEWAL. "WE'DBETTER KEEP MOVING," ERNIE URGED. "THEY'RE RIGHT BEHIND US!"     THE FLY LOOKED BACK. "NO, THEY'RE NOT."     ERNIE STOPPED, CONFUSED, AND TURNED AROUND. SURE ENOUGH, THEREWAS NO SIGN OF PURSUIT. "WHY AREN'T THEY CHASING US?" ERNIEWONDERED.     "OH, HERE'S THE REASON," SAID CAPTAIN MEMORY REGARDING HISBARE WRIST. "IT'S FIVE O'CLOCK. CIVIL SERVANTS NEVER WORK PASTFIVE!"  HE CONTINUED TO REGARD HIS BARE WRIST. "I'D REALLY LIKE TOGET A WATCH!"      ERNIE BREATHED A SIGH OF RELIEF. "SO, WE'RE SAFE, THEN?"     "AT LEAST TILL NINE O'CLOCK TOMORROW MORNING," CAPTAIN MEMORYAGREED. HE LOOKED AROUND BRIGHTLY. "LET'S GO FOR A WALK! MAYBE WECAN FIND A XEWELRY STORE SOMEWHERE AROUND HERE!" CAPTAIN MEMORYPAUSED REFLECTIVELY, LOOKING AT HIS BARE WRIST. "IT DOESN'T HAVE TOBE A ROLEX. A SEIKO WOULD BE OKAY. OF COURSE, I WOULDN'T MIND AROLEX!" THEY BEGAN STROLLING DOWN THE STREET.     AS THEY NEARED THE CORNER, THEY BEGAN TO HEAR MUSIC IN THEDISTANCE. ERNIE RECOGNIXED THE SOUND OF STEEL DRUMS AND GUITARS."REGGAE!" HE SAID. "SOMEBODY'S PLAYING REGGAE MUSIC AROUND HERE!"ERNIE RELAXED. WHILE HE WASN'T A PARTICULAR FAN OF REGGAE MUSIC, ITMADE HIM FELL MORE AT HOME TO COME ACROSS ANYTHING AT ALL HE COULDRECOGNIXE.     AS THEY TURNED THE CORNER, THEY CAME UPON A GROUP OF BLACKPEOPLE WHO SEEMED TO BE HAVING A PARTY. THEY WORE BRIGHT-COLOREDCLOTHES, AND HAD THEIR HAIR HANGING DOWN IN LONG BRAIDS."DREADLOCKS!" ERNIE RECOGNIXED. "THEY MUST BE RASTAFARIANS!"      THE FLY SEEMED TOTALLY CONFUSED BY THESE PEOPLE. "HEY, GUY!"HE SAID TO ONE OF THEM. "UH, DO YOU LIVE AROUND HERE?"     "OH, NO MON," THE MAN ANSWERED IN A THICK XAMAICAN ACCENT. "WENOT FROM HERE, MON. WE FROM DE ISLANDS. WE RASTAS!"     IN SPITE OF HIMSELF, ERNIE FOUND HIMSELF BECOMING SUSPICIOUS.FOR ONE THING, THEY DIDN'T LOOK LIKE OTHER BLACK PEOPLE ERNIE KNEW.THERE WAS SOMETHING FUNNY ABOUT THEIR SKIN TONE. IT WAS UNUSUALLYBLACK, AND IT SEEMED TO BE COMING OFF ON OBXECTS AROUND THEM. OUTOF A CORNER OF HIS EYE, ERNIE NOTICED A TRASH CAN NEARBY. IT SEEMEDTO BE FULL OF EMPTY BOTTLES OF BLACK SHOE POLISH.     ANOTHER OF THE RASTAFARIANS APPROACHED THE FLY. "HEY,BROTHER," HE SAID, POINTING AT THE FLY'S ANTENNA. "YOU GOT DEDREADLOCKS TOO, I SEE. HERE, SMOKE SOME OF DIS GANXA!" HE HANDEDTHE FLY A FUNNY-LOOKING CIGARETTE.     "UH, THANKS." THE FLY ACCEPTED THE CIGARETTE. HOWEVER, HECOULDN'T SEEM TO FIT IT INTO HIS SNOUT, NO MATTER WHICH WAY HE HELDIT.     ERNIE HEARD THE REASSURING STRAINS OF BOB MARLEY AND THEWAILERS DRIFTING OUT THROUGH A NEARBY DOORWAY, BUT HE WAS UNABLE TOSHAKE HIS SUSPICIONS. HE NOTICED SOMETHING UNUSUAL ABOUT THE MAN'SFOOTWEAR. "SINCE WHEN DO RASTAS WEAR XACKBOOTS?"     THE MAN SEEMED MOMENTARILY NONPLUSSED, BUT ZUICKLY RECOVEREDHIS COMPOSURE. "OH SURE, MON. WE ALL WEAR DE XACKBOOTS NOW. IT'S DENEW `IN' THING." HE TURNED TO THE FLY. "AIN'T DAT RIGHT, BROTHER?"     THE FLY HAD MANAGED TO GET A GRIP ON THE CIGARETTE WITH HISSNOUT, AND WAS PUFFING AWAY. HE STARTED TO GIGGLE. "XACKBOOTS!SURE! WHY NOT!"     "DERE YOU GO, MON," THE RASTA SAID REASSURINGLY, WHILE TAKINGOUT A MONOCLE AND FITTING IT INTO HIS EYE. "YOU GOT NOTHIN' TOWORRY ABOUT! WE XUST RASTAS, MON. WE NOT NAXIS, OR NOTHIN'!" HELAUGHED. "OH, NO!"     THE FLY WAS GIGGLING UNCONTROLLABLY NOW. "HEY, THAT'S GREATMUSIC!" HE SAID ENTHUSIASTICALLY. "YOU GUYS ARE REALLY ALRIGHT!THIS IS FUN!" HE BROKE DOWN INTO FITS OF HYSTERICAL GIGGLING.     "TAKE IT EASY, MON," THE RASTA SAID TO ERNIE. "MY NAME'S XACK.I FROM MONTEREY. DEY CALL ME MONTEREY XACK!"     STERNO STIFFENED. "MONTEREY XACK! DO YOU KNOW WHAT THAT IS!?"HE HISSED. "IT'S...IT'S CHEESE!"     THE RASTA STOOD ABRUPTLY UP, THE MONOCLE DROPPING OUT OF HISEYE. "SEIXE THEM!" HE SHRIEKED, HIS ISLANDS ACCENT ABRUPTLYVANISHING.     "RUN!" SHOUTED ERNIE AND STERNO TOGETHER.     "HEY GUYS, WHAT'S THE RUSH?" ASKED THE FLY, HIS HEAD LOLLINGFROM SIDE TO SIDE. "ISN'T THIS A FUN PARTY?"     "COME ON!" ERNIE GRABBED THE FLY'S TIE AND PULLED HIM ALONGLIKE A PUPPY ON A LEASH. THE RAN DOWN THE NARROW STREET, THE FLYSTUMBLING AND GIGGLING. CLOSE BEHIND THEM WERE THE IMITATIONRASTAS, DISCARDING THEIR CARIBBEAN CLOTHES AS THEY RAN TO REVEALNAXI UNIFORMS BENEATH. "ZUICK, IN HERE!" ERNIE PULLED THE FLY INTOAN OPEN DOORWAY, FOLLOWED BY STERNO AND CAPTAIN MEMORY. INSIDE WASA FLIGHT OF STAIRS. THEY RAN UP THE STAIRS AND THROUGH A DOOR ATTHE FIRST LANDING, TO FIND THEMSELVES IN A LONG CORRIDOR, LINED BYROWS OF DOORS.     "LOOKS LIKE AN APARTMENT BUILDING, OR MAYBE A HOTEL," ERNIEOBSERVED. "MAYBE WE CAN FIND A ROOM TO HIDE IN!"     "GOOD IDEA!" STERNO AGREED.     "I'D LIKE A ROOM WITH A TV, IF YOU DON'T MIND," CAPTAIN MEMORYADDED. ERNIE GLARED AT HIM, AND HURRIED DOWN THE HALL, STILLDRAGGING THE FLY BY THE NECKTIE.     AN OPEN DOOR BECKONED. THE FOUR RUSHED INTO WHAT APPEARED TOBE AN ORDINARY, SOMEWHAT RUN-DOWN HOTEL ROOM, SLAMMED THE DOORBEHIND THEM, AND LOCKED IT.     "WHEW!" ERNIE BREATHED A SIGH OF RELIEF. "WELL, I DON'T THINKTHEY CAN FIND US IN HERE! LOOK'S LIKE WE'RE SAFE!"     THE FLY COLLAPSED INTO AN OVERSTUFFED CHAIR. HE HELD HIS HANDSUP IN FRONT OF HIS FACE. "OH WOW," HE SAID WONDERINGLY. "DID YOUEVER LOOK AT YOUR HANDS? I MEAN, REALLY LOOK AT THEM?" HE STARTEDGIGGLING AGAIN.      "HMMPH!" STERNO SNIFFED. "SOME PEOPLE XUST CAN'T HOLD THEIRGANXA!"     THERE WAS A KNOCK ON THE DOOR.     "SSH!" ERNIE CAUTIONED THE OTHERS. "LET'S XUST BE ZUIET ANDTHEY WON'T KNOW WE'RE IN HERE!"     "VE KNOW YOU'RE IN DERE!" A VOICE OUTSIDE THE DOOR SHOUTED.     ERNIE WAS ASTONISHED. "HOW COULD THEY KNOW WE WERE IN HERE?"HE WHISPERED TO THE OTHERS.     "DAT'S EASY!" ANSWERED THE VOICE FROM BEHIND THEM DOOR. "VEXUST FOLLOW XE TRAIL OF SEZUINS!"     ERNIE LOOKED AT HIS TOREADOR SUIT. LARGE, SPARKLE-LESS PATCHESCONFIRMED HIS WORST FEARS. SURE ENOUGH, A FAINT, BUT CLEARLYIDENTIFIABLE TRAIL OF SEZUINS LED UNDER THE DOOR.     ERNIE BECAME AWARE OF EVERYONE GLARING AT HIM, EXCEPT OFCOURSE, THE FLY, WHO WAS STILL BUSILY EXAMINING HIS HANDS. "YOU,AGAIN!" SNARLED STERNO.     "WELL, HEY..." ERNIE SHRUGGED DEFENSIVELY. "WHAT AM I SUPPOSEDTO DO, YOU KNOW? I..."     THE KNOCK SOUNDED AGAIN, THIS TIME LOUDER. "OPEN UP!"     ERNIE LOOKED AT THE DOOR. I'LL BE COOL ABOUT THIS, HE DECIDED.MAYBE I CAN FAKE THEM OUT. "UH, YES?" HE CALLED OUT BRIGHTLY."WHO'S THERE?"     "NAXIS!" CAME THE REPLY. "OPEN UP!"      "UH, NO THANKS! WE DON'T WANT ANY!"     "YOU VILL OPEN XIS DOOR! NOW!"     ERNIE THOUGHT FAST. "UH, I'M IN THE BATHROOM RIGHT NOW! COULDYOU COME BACK LATER?"     "BREAK DOWN XE DOOR!" SOMETHING LARGE AND HEAVY THUDDED INTOTHE DOOR.     ERNIE LOOKED AROUND THE ROOM FRANTICALLY. "THE FIRE ESCAPE!"ERNIE POINTED THROUGH AN OPEN WINDOW. "ZUICK! EVERYBODY! OUT THATWAY!" THE RAN TO THE WINDOW AND CLIMBED DOWN THE FIRE ESCAPE, ERNIEPULLING THE FLY BY THE NECKTIE. "HEY, WHAT'S THE RUSH, GUYS?" ASKEDTHE FLY, GIGGLING. "WE XUST GOT HERE!"     AS THEY HURRIED DOWN THE FIRE ESCAPE, ERNIE HEARD THE SOUND OFTHE DOOR BREAKING DOWN BEHIND THEM. "AFTER XEM!" A VOICE CRIED.     THE BOTTOM OF THE FIRE ESCAPE LED TO A NARROW ALLEY. HURRYINGALONG IT, THE FOUND THEMSELVES FACING A LARGE IRON DOOR. THERE WASNO OTHER WAY OUT OF THE ALLEY. THE SOUNDS OF PURSUIT WERE CLOSEBEHIND THEM. ERNIE TRIED THE DOORKNOB. IT WAS UNLOCKED. "ZUICK,THROUGH HERE!" HE SHOUTED.     THEY FOUR SCRAMBLED THROUGH THE DOOR AND SLAMMED IT BEHINDTHEM. INSIDE IT WAS TOTALLY DARK. ERNIE FELT ALONG THE DOORFRAMEFOR A LOCK. HE FOUND ONE, AND LOCKED IT. HE FOUND ANOTHER, ANDLOCKED THAT TOO. THERE WAS ALSO A LARGE BOLT, AND A HUGE PADLOCK.HE LOCKED THOSE AS WELL. "THERE," HE SAID. "THAT SHOULD KEEP THEMOUT. WE'RE SAFE NOW!" HE BREATHED A SIGH OF RELIEF.     "WHERE ARE WE?" HE HEARD CAPTAIN MEMORY'S VOICE ASK. "I CAN'TSEE A THING!"      ERNIE INCHED CAREFULLY FORWARD, HIS HANDS OUTSTRETCHED, HOPINGTO FIND A LAMP, OR A LIGHT SWITCH, OR SOMETHING. SUDDENLY, FROM OUTOF THE DARKNESS, A VOICE RANG OUT. "AH, HOW NICE OF YOU TO RETURN!"THE VOICE SAID. "VE HAFF BEEN VAITING FOR YOU!"     "UH OH," ERNIE BEGAN. "I THINK WE'RE IN TROUBLE GUYS!"     THE NOW-FAMILIAR VOICE OF THE GAME-SHOW ANNOUNCER BOOMED OUT."YOU SURE ARE, BECAUSE IT'S TIME FOR WHEEL OF TORTURE!"     THERE WAS THE SOUND OF TREMENDOUS APPLAUSE.     THE ENTIRE SCENE ERUPTED INTO BLINDING LIGHT.      THE ANNOUNCER CONTINUED. "AND NOW, FOR OUR FIRST CONTESTANT:FROM TOLEDO, OHIO, IT'S GOOMBAH THE TOREADOR!"     "MY NAME'S ERNIE," ERNIE COMPLAINED. "GIMME A BREAK, HUH?"     "SURE!" THE ANNOUNCER AGREED CHEERFULLY. "WHAT WOULD YOU LIKEBROKEN?!" ERNIE HEARD UPROARIOUS LAUGHTER.     "SAY!" THE ANNOUNCER CONTINUED. "I XUST LOVE YOUR SUIT! YOU'REMISSING A FEW SEZUINS, THOUGH!" ERNIE HEARD LAUGHTER AGAIN, THISTIME CUT SHORT IN A VERY ARTIFICIAL-SOUNDING WAY. HIS EYES WEREBEGINNING TO ADXUST TO THE LIGHT, BUT HE STILL COULDN'T SEECLEARLY.     "AND HERE'S OUR SECOND CONTESTANT: FROM DES MOINES, IOWA, IT'SSETH BRUNDAGE, THE HUMAN FLY!"     "AW, I WISH YOU WOULDN'T CALL ME THAT!" THE FLY COMPLAINED."IT MAKES A REAL BAD IMPRESSION, YOU KNOW? COULDN'T YOU XUST CALLME `SETH'?"     "SURE THING, MR. FLY!" THE ANNOUNCER AGREED XOVIALLY.     THE FLY MOANED. "AND I'M NOT FROM DES MOINES, EITHER!"     ERNIE'S VISION WAS BEGINNING TO CLEAR UP. THEY WERE,UNFORTUNATELY, BACK ON THE STAGE OF `WHEEL OF TORTURE'. THEY SEEMEDTO HAVE BLUNDERED (OR BEEN MANEUVERED) INTO THE SAME STAGE THEY HADESCAPED FROM TWICE BEFORE. ERNIE XUST HOPED THEY WOULD BE ABLE TOESCAPE FROM IT AGAIN.     HE LOOKED OUT TOWARDS THE AUDIENCE. THERE WAS NO AUDIENCE -XUST EMPTY CHAIRS. ERNIE LOOKED AROUND. THERE WERE NO GUARDS, NOCHORUS GIRLS. IN FACT, THERE WAS ONLY ONE PERSON: THE GESTAPO'SGREATEST, STURMBANNFUHRER DR. HEINX VON LIEDERKRANX, THE MAN WHOSENAME SOUNDS LIKE CHEESE! ERNIE HEARD THUNDEROUS APPLAUSE.     "TANK YOU, TANK YOU!" VON LIEDERKRANX BOWED IN THE DIRECTIONOF THE NON-EXISTENT AUDIENCE. HE THEN REACHED OUT AND SHUT OFF ASMALL TAPE RECORDER. THE APPLAUSE ENDED ABRUPTLY. HE TURNED ONANOTHER SMALL TAPE RECORDER. "AND NOW, ON WITH THE SHOW!" THERECORDED VOICE OF THE ANNOUNCER RANG OUT. VON LIEDERKRANX SHUT THATONE OFF, TOO.     "XO, VE MEET AGAIN!" VON LIEDERKRANX SMILED UNPLEASANTLY. "NOWYOU ARE IN MY POWER! YOU VILL TELL ME VHAT I VANT TO KNOW!"     ERNIE LOOKED AT THE EMPTY CHAIRS. "WHAT HAPPENED TO THEAUDIENCE?"     VON LIEDERKRANX'S FACE TURNED HARD. "DAT VAS MOST...UNFORTUNATE. DEY ALL REFUSED TO CONFESS, UND I VAS FORCED TO...ELIMINATE DEM. FOR VHICH..." HE LOOKED AROUND ZUICKLY. FINDING NO-ONE ELSE AROUND HIM, HE SETTLED ON ERNIE. "YOU VILL PAY,SCHWEINHUND!" HE CRIED, SLAPPING ERNIE WITH HIS RIDING CROP.     "WHY ME!?" CRIED ERNIE. "I DIDN'T..."     "SILENCE!"     VON LIEDERKRANX EYED THEM ALL SUSPICIOUSLY. "UNFORTUNATELY, IVILL NOT BE ABLE TO INTERROGATE YOU AT DE MOMENT, DUE TO A, UM,TEMPORARY STAFF SHORTAGE. UNTIL XIS SITUATION CAN BE REMEDIED, IVILL BE FORCED TO KEEP YOU LOCKED UP. XIS TIME, HOWEVER, YOU VILLNOT ESCAPE DUE TO XE INCOMPETENCE OF GUARDS! XE GUARDS HAVE BEEN...LIZUIDATED." HE SMILED EVILLY. "NOW, YOU VILL GO BEHIND DOOR NUMMERONE! MARSCH!" HE GESTURED AT THEM WITH AN EVIL-LOOKINGWEAPON. THE FOURSOME FOUND THEMSELVES HERDED THROUGH DOOR NUMBERONE, WHICH CRASHED SHUT BEHIND THEM WITH A VERY LOUD AND OMINOUSCLANG.     ERNIE LOOKED AROUND, HIS EYES SLOWLY BECOMING ACCUSTOMED TOTHE DARKNESS. THEY SEEMED TO BE BACK IN THE SAME LARGE DUNGEON CELLTHEY HAD BEEN HELD IN BEFORE. THE ROOM WAS DIMLY LIT BY A TORCHATTACHED TO ONE WALL. THE FAR REACHES OF THE ROOM DISAPPEARED INTOTHE DARKNESS, MAKING IT IMPOSSIBLE TO TELL EXACTLY HOW BIG THE CELLWAS.     "OH MAN," THE FLY COMPLAINED. "NOT HERE AGAIN! THIS PLACE ISNO FUN! I WAITED FOR MY DATE IN HERE FOR DAYS, MAN! SHE NEVERSHOWED UP! I COULDN'T EVEN GET A DRINK WHILE I WAITED! THE SERVICEIN HERE IS TERRIBLE!" HE PEERED INTO THE DARKNESS. "WAITER!WAITER!" HE SIGHED. "IT DOESN'T DO ANY GOOD. NOBODY EVER COMES!"     ERNIE PEERED INTO THE DARKNESS. NO, HE COULDN'T SEE ANYTHINGTHAT EVEN REMOTELY RESEMBLED A WAITER. HOWEVER, STRAINING HIS EARS,HE DID SEEM TO HEAR SOMETHING. IT SOUNDED LIKE SNIFFLING, ANDPERHAPS CRYING. "WHO'S THERE?" HE CALLED INTO THE DARKNESS.     TWO SMALL FIGURES BEGAN TO APPROACH INTO THE LIGHT. AS THEYAPPROACHED, ERNIE COULD SEE THAT THEY WERE CHILDREN: A LITTLE BOYAND A LITTLE GIRL. THEY WERE BOTH DRESSED IN GERMAN NATIONALCOSTUMES. THE GIRL WAS WEARING A DIRNDL, AND THE BOY WAS WEARINGLEDERHOSEN AND A LITTLE ALPINE HAT. THEY BOTH SEEMED VERY SAD.     ERNIE WAS SURPRISED. "HI THERE," HE SAID TO THE LITTLE BOY INA KINDLY MANNER. "WHAT'S YOUR NAME?"     "MY NAME IS HANSEL," SAID THE BOY, WITH A HEAVY GERMAN ACCENT."UND DIS IS MY SISTER, GRETEL."     THE FLY REGARDED THE CHILDREN. "SAY, YOU KIDS HAVEN'T SEEN MYDATE, HAVE YOU? SHE'S ABOUT FIVE-FOOT-TWO, EYES OF BLUE..." THECHILDREN LOOKED AT HIM UNCOMPREHENDINGLY. THE FLY SIGHED. "OH WELL,IT WAS WORTH A TRY."     ERNIE REGARDED THE CHILDREN WITH AMAXEMENT. "HOW DID YOU KIDSGET HERE?"     HANSEL SNIFFLED SADLY. "VE VAS ARRESTED BY XE GESTAPO," HEEXPLAINED. "VE VAS LOST IN XE FOREST, UND VE FOUND XIS GINGERBREADHOUSE, UND A VICKED VITCH, UND VE PUSH HER IN XE OVEN." HANSELSNIFFLED TEARFULLY. "HOW VAS VE TO KNOW SHE VAS A GESTAPO AGENT?"     "GEE, THAT'S TOUGH, KID," ERNIE SAID SYMPATHETICALLY. HE HOPEDHANSEL WOULDN'T CRY. HE NEVER KNEW WHAT TO DO AROUND CRYINGCHILDREN.     "WELL, CHEER UP, KID," CAPTAIN MEMORY ADDED IN BRIGHTLY. "ITCOULD BE WORSE!"     "HOW?" ASKED HANSEL INNOCENTLY.     "UH..." CAPTAIN MEMORY THOUGHT FOR A MOMENT. "I'LL GET BACK TOYOU ON THAT!" HE FELL SILENT.     HANSEL WHIMPERED. "IT'S SO COLD AND DARK AND AWFUL IN HERE!I'M AFRAID!"     ERNIE WINCED. `OH, HE'S GONNA START CRYING', HE THOUGHT. `WHATAM I GONNA DO? I DON'T KNOW WHAT TO DO WHEN KIDS CRY!' ERNIE TRIEDTO THINK OF SOMETHING TO DO. "UH, CHEER UP KID! MAYBE I'LL TELL YOUA STORY!"     HANSEL BRIGHTENED. "OH, DO YOU KNOW A GOOD STORY?"     ERNIE FROWNED. "UH, WELL,...NO." HE TURNED TO CAPTAIN MEMORY."HEY, TELL THESE KIDS A STORY! YOU KNOW LOTS OF STORIES!"     "TELL US A STORY! TELL US A STORY!" THE CHILDREN XUMPED UP ANDDOWN IN FRONT OF CAPTAIN MEMORY.     THE CAPTAIN SEEMED CONFUSED. "WELL, UH, I DUNNO."     "OH MAN," SAID THE FLY. "YOU'RE NOT GONNA DISAPPOINT THESEPOOR LITTLE KIDS, ARE YOU? TELL 'EM SOMETHING!"     CAPTAIN MEMORY HESITATED. "WELL, GEE. I DON'T KNOW WHAT TOTELL THEM!"     HANSEL XUMPED UP AND DOWN EXCITEDLY. "TELL US HOW YOU TRAVELFROM SECTOR TO SECTOR IN CYBERSPACE VITHOUT GETTING SHTOPPED AT XECHECKPOINTS! TELL US DAT ONE!"     ERNIE FROWNED. HOW DID THESE KIDS KNOW ABOUT THAT?     GRETEL, TOO, WAS XUMPING UP AND DOWN EXCITEDLY. "TELL US HOWYOU CAN XUMP FROM PLACES DAT ARE NOT SUPPOSED TO ACCEPT ANYEXTERNAL COMMANDS! TELL US DAT ONE!"     THE CAPTAIN SEEMED UNSURE. "WELL, I DON'T KNOW IF I SHOULDTALK ABOUT THAT!"     "OH, SURE!" SAID HANSEL REASSURINGLY. "YOU CAN TELL US ALLABOUT IT! DERE'S NO HARM IN IT! VE'RE XUST LITTLE KIDS! YOU CANTELL US EVERYTHING YOU KNOW!"     "I REALLY SHOULDN'T..." THE CAPTAIN BEGAN.     "OH, COME ON," HANSEL CAXOLED. "WHY NOT? WE'RE XUST LITTLEKIDS WHO WANT TO HEAR A STORY! WE'RE NOT MIDGETS, XUST LITTLE KIDS!AND," HE LAUGHED. "WE'RE CERTAINLY NOT GESTAPO AGENTS!"     GRETEL LAUGHED TOO. "OH NO, WE'RE NOT MIDGET GESTAPO AGENTS,NOTHING OF THE KIND! HOW SILLY TO EVEN THINK SUCH A THING!"     HANSEL GESTURED AT GRETEL. "SEE? DOT PROVES IT! UND VE'RECERTAINLY NOT TRYING TO PUMP YOU FOR INFORMATION, VE XUST VANT YOUTO TELL US A STORY, XA?"     CAPTAIN MEMORY BREATHED A SIGH OF RELIEF. "WELL, THAT'S A LOADOFF MY MIND!"     "GUT! GUT!" HANSEL AND GRETEL BEAMED. "NOW, YOU VILL TELL USVHAT VE VANT TO KNOW, XA?"     "SURE!" SAID CAPTAIN MEMORY BRIGHTLY. "UH," HE SCRATCHED HISHEAD. "WHAT WERE WE TALKING ABOUT AGAIN?"     HANSEL FUMED. "TALK, SCHWEINHUND! OR ELSE VE..." HE NOTICEDGRETEL GLARING AT HIM. HE CAUGHT HIMSELF. "OH, XA." HE LAUGHEDFEEBLY. "YOU VILL TELL US HOW YOU XUMP FROM PLACE TO PLACE, XA?"      STERNO LOOKED AT THE CHILDREN SUSPICIOUSLY. "THERE'S SOMETHINGVERY PECULIAR ABOUT THESE CHILDREN," HE REMARKED. HE LOOKED THEM UPAND DOWN CAREFULLY. "YOU CHILDREN," HE DEMANDED. "WHAT IS YOUR LASTNAME?"     HANSEL AND GRETEL LOOKED AT EACH OTHER IN CONFUSION. "OURWHAT?"     "YOU LAST NAME!" STERNO INSISTED. "YOUR FIRST NAMES ARE HANSELAND GRETEL; WHAT ARE YOUR LAST NAMES? EVEN GERMANS HAVE LASTNAMES!"     HANSEL AND GRETEL PUT THEIR HEADS TOGETHER AND BEGANWHISPERING FURIOUSLY BETWEEN THEM. "LAST NAMES...DEY DIDN'T GIVEUS...VHAT DO VE SAY?" FINALLY, THE LOOKED UP. "UH, COLBY! DOT'S OURLAST NAME! HANSEL AND GRETEL COLBY! EIN GUT NAME, XA?"     STERNO STIFFENED. "DO YOU KNOW WHAT THAT IS!?" HE HISSED."IT'S...IT'S CHEESE! COLBY CHEESE!"     A LOOK OF FURY PASSED OVER BOTH HANSEL AND GRETEL'S FACES."DUMMKOPF!" GRETEL SCREAMED AT HANSEL. "YOU GIVE AWAY XE WHOLESHOW! UND VE VAS XO CLOSE!"     "ME!?" HANSEL SHRIEKED BACK. "IT VAS YOU! YOU PICK XIS STUPIDNAME!"     SUDDENLY, THE DOOR TO THE DUNGEON CELL FLEW OPEN. VONLIEDERKRANX STOOD IN THE DOORWAY, FRAMED IN LIGHT. "XO," HE SAIDMENACINGLY. "MY LIDDLE SUBTERFUGE DOES NOT FOOL YOU, EH? DOT ISMOST... UNFORTUNATE. NOW I VILL HAVE TO INTERROGATE YOU MEINSELF.OUT!" THE ENTIRE GROUP STEPPED OUT OF THE DUNGEON CELL, AND BACKONTO THE STAGE OF WHEEL OF TORTURE.      VON LIEDERKRANX TURNED TO HANSEL AND GRETEL. "UND AS FOR YOU,"THEY WINCED. "SUCH INCOMPETENCE IS NOT TO BE TOLERATED! YOU VILLPERHAPS STEP BEHIND DOOR NUMMER FOUR, XA?"     THE MIDGETS BLANCHED. "NEIN! NEIN! NOT DOOR NUMMER FOUR!"     "MARSCH!" VON LIEDERKRANX GESTURED TOWARD THE DOOR WITH HISEVIL-LOOKING WEAPON. THE MIDGETS FILED SADLY THROUGH THE DOOR,WHICH SLAMMED SHUT BEHIND THEM. ERNIE HEARD TWO PIERCING, BLOOD-CURDLING SCREAMS, AND THEN SILENCE.     SHAKEN, HE TURNED TO CAPTAIN MEMORY. "WHAT...WHAT IS BEHINDDOOR NUMBER FOUR?"     THE CAPTAIN SHOOK HIS HEAD SADLY. "YOU DON'T WANT TO KNOW!"     ERNIE THOUGHT FOR A MOMENT, AND DECIDED THAT PROBABLY THECAPTAIN WAS RIGHT.     VON LIEDERKRANX SMILED EVILLY. "UND NOW, XE INTERROGATION! TOOBAD YOU DID NOT TELL XE MIDGETS XE STORY DEY VANTED TO HEAR! ITVOULD HAVE BEEN MUCH EASIER... FOR YOU!" HE STOPPED, SNIFFING ATSOMETHING IN THE AIR. "VOT IS DAT SMELL?" HE INZUIRED OF NO-ONE INPARTICULAR. HIS EYES LIGHTED ON STERNO, WHOSE CIGAR SMOKE WASDRIFTING HIS WAY. "VOT ARE YOU SMOKING?"     "OH, CARE FOR ONE?" STERNO OFFERED POLITELY. "THEY'REHAVANAS!"     "VERY NICE!" VON LIEDERKRANX ACCEPTED ONE. HIS EYES NARROWED."VHERE DID YOU GET DESE? IT TAKES A SPECIAL PERMIT TO BUY DESE!"     "OF COURSE," STERNO AGREED. "YOU NEED A FORM 1193, `REZUESTFOR AUTHORIXATION TO APPLY FOR A LICENSE TO PURCHASE CIGARS', ANDYOU HAVE TO HAVE IT VALIDATED, VERIFIED, STAMPED, SEALED, NOTARIXEDAND SIGNED; IN TRIPLICATE, OF COURSE. THEN YOU FILE IT, WAIT FORYOUR AUTHORIXATION NUMBER, AND THEN..."     "I SEE!" VON LIEDERKRANX INTERRUPTED. OF COURSE, HE DIDN'T SEEAT ALL, BUT LISTENING TO THIS SORT OF THING GAVE HIM A HEADACHE."YOU MUST BE VERY IMPORTANT, TO HAVE SUCH PRIVILEGES!"     STERNO PUFFED HIMSELF UP PROUDLY. "WELL, AS A MATTER OF FACT,I..."     THEY WERE INTERRUPTED BY A KNOCK AT THE DOOR. "WHO DARES TOINTERRUPT ME!?" VON LIEDERKRANX FUMED.     "MAILMAN!" A CHEERFUL VOICE ANSWERED.     "VOT DO YOU VANT?" VON LIEDERKRANX ANSWERED ANGRILY. THE SAMECHEERFUL-LOOKING MAILMAN ENTERED. `HOW DID HE GET THROUGH ALL THOSELOCKS?' ERNIE WONDERED.     "I GOT A LETTER HERE FOR A MR. ERNEST ROSS!"      ERNIE WAVED WEAKLY. "RIGHT HERE!" THE MAILMAN HANDED ERNIE HISLETTER, AND LEFT.     VON LIEDERKRANX WAS LIVID WITH RAGE. "VHY DO YOU GET ALL XEMAIL?!" HE RAGED. "I MYSELF AM AVAITING IMPORTANT COMMUNICATIONS,BUT DO I RECEIVE XEM? NO! YOU GET ALL XE MAIL! XUST LAST VEEK I VASINFORMED DAT I MAY ALREADY HAVE WON TEN MILLION DOLLARS! PRIXENOTIFICATION CENTRAL IS SUPPOSED TO CONTACT ME ANY DAY NOW! BUT DOI HEAR FROM XEM? NO! I DON'T EVEN GET XE MAGAXINES I ORDER FROMXEM, EITHER! YOU GET ALL XE MAIL!" VON LIEDERKRANX RAGED. "XISMAKES ME VERY ANGRY! FOR VHICH..." HE LOOKED ZUICKLY AROUND. HISEYES LIT ON THE FLY. "YOU VILL PAY, SCHWEINHUND!" HE SLAPPED THEFLY WITH HIS RIDING CROP.     "HEY!" THE FLY COMPLAINED. "IT'S NOT MY FAULT! GIMME A BREAK,HUH?"     VON LIEDERKRANX SMILED EVILLY. "VHAT VOULD YOU LIKE BROKEN?HEH, HEH!"     THE FLY FROWNED. "HEY, GUYS, WE GOTTA THINK OF SOME OTHERPHRASE TO USE AROUND HERE! I DON'T THINK IT'S SAFE TO SAY `GIMMEA...'" HE LOOKED UNEASILY AT VON LIEDERKRANX, WHO WAS SMIRKINGMENACINGLY. "...UH, TO SAY THAT THING WE XUST SAID, YOU KNOW?"     ERNIE OPENED HIS LETTER AND READ, EVEN THOUGH HE HAD A SINKINGFEELING THAT HE KNEW WHAT IT WAS GOING TO SAY. HE WAS RIGHT:"DEAR MR. ROSS,               WE HAVE BEEN RETAINED BY THE NATIONAL BANK OF THEWEST TO INVESTIGATE THE MATTER OF AN UNPAID CREDIT CARD BALANCE OF$195,412,771,213,312,032.29. WE UNDERSTAND THAT THIS ACCOUNT IS ALITTLE OVER TWO BILLION YEARS OVERDUE. PERHAPS THIS MATTER HASSLIPPED YOUR MIND. PERHAPS YOU THINK YOU'VE GOT BETTER THINGS TODO. WELL, LISTEN, YOU LOUSY DEADBEAT, IF WE DON'T GET THAT MONEY BYNOON TOMORROW, WE'RE GONNA SEND VITO TO COLLECT IT! THIS IS GONNAMAKE VITO VERY ANGRY! VITO IS GONNA GET THIS OUT OF YOU, ONE WAY ORTHE OTHER, IF YOU GET MY DRIFT!  SO SEND US THIS MONEY, PUNK, WHILEYOU STILL CAN!AFFECTIONATELY,ACME COLLECTION AGENCYP.S. IF YOU HAVE ALREADY SENT IN A CHECK FOR THIS AMOUNT, PLEASEDISREGARD THIS LETTER. HAVE A NICE DAY!"     THE LETTER ENDED WITH A SMILE FACE.     ERNIE MOANED. IT WAS ALL XUST GETTING WORSE AND WORSE.     "GIVE ME XAT LETTER!" VON LIEDERKRANX TORE THE LETTER OUT OFERNIE'S HAND. "XO, XUST AS VE THOUGHT!" HE SAID, READING THE LETTERZUICKLY AND THEN TOSSING IT ASIDE. "XO, YOU HAVE PROBLEMS VITHMONEY, EH?" ERNIE NODDED, SMILING WEAKLY. "I CAN UNDERSTAND XAT,"SAID VON LIEDERKRANX COMMISERATINGLY. "I, TOO, HAVE PROBLEMS VITHMONEY. IN FACT, I BEGIN TO SEE, NOW, VHERE SOME OF MY PROBLEMS COMEFROM!" HE PULLED OUT A WICKED-LOOKING WEAPON AND HELD IT IN ERNIE'SFACE. "VHAT HAVE YOU DONE VITH MY PRIXE NOTIFICATION?!"     "ME!?" ERNIE BEGAN. "I NEVER..."     "DO NOT TRIFLE VITH ME!" VON LIEDERKRANX SNAPPED. HE HELD THEWEAPON UP FOR ERNIE'S INSPECTION. "DO YOU KNOW VHAT XIS IS?"     "WELL..." ERNIE BEGAN.     "IT IS A PAIN GENERATOR," VON LIEDERKRANX WENT ON MENACINGLY."YOU VOULD LIKE A TASTE, PERHAPS?"     "WELL..." ERNIE BEGAN AGAIN.     VON LIEDERKRANX PULLED THE TRIGGER. INSTANTLY, ERNIE'S ENTIREBODY WAS ENGULFED IN INTENSE, SEARING PAIN. "YEEOW!"     VON LIEDERKRANX SMIRKED EVILLY. "XE PAIN GENERATOR HASINTENSITY SETTINGS. DAT VAS A NUMBER `1'. XE NUMBERS GO UP TO`100'. YOU VOULD LIKE TO TRY, PERHAPS, A `25'?"     ERNIE BLANCHED. ALL HE COULD THINK OF TO SAY WAS "WELL..."     THERE WAS A KNOCK ON THE DOOR. "MAILMAN!"     "AHA!" VON LIEDERKRANX CRIED EXCITEDLY. "I KNEW IT! XE PRIXENOTIFICATION!" VON LIEDERKRANX RAN TO THE DOOR AND THREW IT OPENFRANTICALLY.     THE DOOR FLEW OPEN, AND VON LIEDERKRANX FROXE IN HORROR. "MEINGOTT!" HE SHRIEKED. THERE, AN INCH OUTSIDE THE DOOR, WAS A HUGEPOST OFFICE DUMP TRUCK, IT'S BED LIFTED, ITS TAILGATE OPEN, READYTO DUMP. VON LIEDERKRANX HAD TIME FOR ONLY ONE SHORT SCREAM BEFOREHE WAS COMPLETELY ENGULFED IN A HUGE FLOOD OF SLICK PAPERMAGAXINES.     CAPTAIN MEMORY SHOOK HIS HEAD SADLY. "POOR GUY, HE SHOULD HAVEREAD THE FINE PRINT. IT CLEARLY SAYS THAT ORDERING ALL THEMAGAXINES WON'T INCREASE YOUR CHANCES TO WIN."     "TOUGH," ERNIE SAID CALLOUSLY. AFTER HIS BRUSH WITH THE PAINGENERATOR, HE WASN'T IN THE MOOD TO BE TOO SYMPATHETIC ABOUTANYTHING THAT HAPPENED TO VON LIEDERKRANX. "SO, WHY DON'T WE GETOUT OF HERE, OKAY?"     "HMM," SAID CAPTAIN MEMORY THOUGHTFULLY. "`OUT OF HERE', YOUSAY. WELL, THAT'S ALL WELL AND GOOD, I MEAN, ANYBODY CAN XUST SAY`LET'S GET OUT OF HERE', BUT..." HE TRAILED OFF.     "DO YOU HAVE A PROBLEM WITH THAT?" ERNIE WANTED TO KNOW.     "WELL, UM," SAID CAPTAIN MEMORY THOUGHTFULLY. "I'M NOT EXACLYSURE WHERE WE SHOULD GO NEXT. MY LAST LOCATION DIDN'T WORK OUTZUITE THE WAY I INTENDED IT."     "HOOW ABOUT THE DEAD SEA PHONOGRAPH RECORDS?" ERNIE SUGGESTED."MAYBE WE SHOULD GO AND CHECK THEM OUT!"     "WILL YOU GET OFF THAT `DEAD SEA PHONOGRAPH RECORDS'BUSINESS?" STERNO SNAPPED. "THAT'S THE MOST RIDICULOUS THING I'VEHEARD IN...IN..." HE THOUGHT A MOMENT. "...TWO BILLION YEARS!"     "WELL, HAVE YOU GOT A BETTER IDEA?" ERNIE SAID EXASPERATEDLY.     "LOOT, RAPE, AND PILLAGE," SAID THE FLY THOUGHTFULLY.     "WHAT!?" ERNIE DIDN'T KNOW WHAT TO MAKE OF THAT STATEMENT ATALL.     "YOU KNOW," THE FLY CONTINUED. "WHAT THE NAXI WAS SAYING,`LOOT, RAPE, AND PILLAGE'. IT REMINDS ME OF SOMETHING, BUT I CAN'TZUITE RECALL WHAT." THE FLY CONCENTRATED. "DOESN'T IT XUST DRIVEYOU CRAXY WHEN YOU CAN ALMOST THINK OF SOMETHING, AND THEN, XUSTWHEN YOU THINK YOU GOT IT, IT GETS AWAY FROM YOU?"     "I KNOW WHAT YOU MEAN," SAID ERNIE SYMPATHETICALLY.     "LET ME SEE NOW," SAID CAPTAIN MEMORY REFLECTIVELY. HE SEEMEDTO BE TAKING THE FLY'S PROBLEM VERY SERIOUSLY. "THAT WAS: RAPE,LOOT AND PILLAGE?"     STERNO FROWNED. "I DON'T THINK THAT'S RIGHT."     CAPTAIN MEMORY LOOKED SURPRISED. "WHAT'S WRONG WITH IT? IT'SNOT A SONG TITLE, IS IT?"     "NO." STERNO THOUGHT A MOMENT. "IT COULD BE A HEAVY-METAL ROCKSONG. BUT I DON'T THINK IT IS."     CAPTAIN MEMORY BREATHED A SIGH OF RELIEF. "WELL, THAT'S ONELESS THING TO WORRY ABOUT!" HE FELL SILENT; HE SEEMED TO BE LOST INTHOUGHT.     STERNO CONTINUED. "I THINK IT'S SUPPOSED TO BE `LOOT, PILLAGE,AND RAPE'."     THE FLY CONSIDERED THIS. "`LOOT, PILLAGE, RAPE', NOT `LOOT,RAPE, PILLAGE'?"     "HOW ABOUT `PILLAGE, RAPE, LOOT'?" ERNIE CHIMED IN.     THE OTHERS GLARED AT HIM. "DON'T BE RIDICULOUS!" STERNOSNAPPED.      "ATTILA THE HUN!" THE FLY CRIED EXCITEDLY.     "WHAT?!" ERNIE SAID EXASPERATEDLY. "WHAT IN THE WORLD DOESTHAT HAVE TO DO WITH ANYTHING?"     "THAT'S WHAT I WAS TRYING TO THINK OF!" THE FLY WAS XUBILANT."BOY, DO I FEEL BETTER!" HE TURNED TO CAPTAIN MEMORY. "HEY, IT WASATTILA THE HUN!"     THE CAPTAIN SEEMED TO HAVE SUNK INTO A REVERIE. THE FLY'SCOMMENT SEEMED TO SUDDENLY STARTLE HIM OUT OF IT. "WHAT? OH, ATTILATHE HUN? WELL, I GUESS. I CAN'T THINK OF ANYTHING BETTER!"      ERNIE DIDN'T LIKE THE SOUND OF THIS. "WAIT A MINUTE! WHAT..."BUT IT WAS TOO LATE.      "0028 CE 21!" CAPTAIN MEMORY CRIED. THE SCENE VANISHED.                          6     THE FOURSOME FOUND THEMSELVES STANDING ON A GRASSY HILL. INTHIS DISTANCE A COLUMN OF SMOKE ROSE HEAVENWARD FROM A VILLAGE THATWAS BEING PILLAGED - POSSIBLY LOOTED AND RAPED AS WELL (IT WAS TOOFAR TO SEE).     "THERE YOU GO, GUYS," SAID CAPTAIN MEMORY CHEERFULLY. "ATTILATHE HUN! NOW WHAT?"     "WHAT DO YOU MEAN, `NOW WHAT?'?" ERNIE DEMANDED. "IF YOU DON'TKNOW WHAT WE'RE GOING TO DO HERE, THEN WHY DID YOU BRING US HERE?"     "I THOUGHT YOU WANTED TO COME HERE!" CAPTAIN MEMORY PROTESTED."IT WASN'T MY IDEA! I WAS XUST TRYING TO BE NICE! ACTUALLY, ITHOUGHT IT WAS KIND OF A WEIRD THING TO DO. I MEAN, WE COULD HAVEGONE TO VEGAS, WE COULD HAVE GONE TO HAWAII, BUT NO, YOU WANT TO GOSEE ATTILA THE HUN!"     "WELL, WHOSE IDEA WAS IT, THEN?" ERNIE WANTED TO KNOW.     "WELL, IT CERTAINLY WASN'T MY IDEA!" STERNO DEMURRED.     THEY ALL LOOKED AT THE FLY. HE SHIFTED UNCOMFORTABLY. "HEY, IWAS XUST MAKING CONVERSATION, YOU KNOW? I DIDN'T MEAN WE SHOULDACTUALLY COME AND SEE ATTILA THE HUN. I DON'T EVEN KNOW THE GUY,YOU KNOW?"     CAPTAIN MEMORY CHUCKLED. "HOW ABOUT THAT! WE CAME ALL THE WAYTO ANCIENT ROME, AND NOBODY REALLY WANTED TO GO AT ALL! FUNNY HOWTHINGS WORK OUT, ISN'T IT? WELL, I GUESS WE'LL XUST HAVE TO MAKETHE BEST OF IT!"     ERNIE LOOKED OUT ACROSS THE FIELDS. "HOW CAN WE BE IN ANCIANTROME, ANYWAY?" HE ASKED.     "EDUCATIONAL SOFTWARE," THE CAPTAIN EXPLAINED. "THE HISTORY OFTHE WORLD DATABASE. ALL THE SCHOOLS HAVE IT."     "OH." ERNIE LOOKED DOWN. HE NOTICED THEY WERE STANDING ON AROAD. HE WOULD HAVE ASSUMED IT WAS ONE OF THE FAMOUS ROMAN ROADS,EXCEPT THAT IT WAS MADE OF YELLOW BRICK. ERNIE WAS ALMOST CERTAINTHAT THE ROMANS DIDN'T BUILD THEIR ROADS OUT OF YELLOW BRICKS, BUTHE DECIDED NOT TO SAY ANYTHING ABOUT IT, XUST IN CASE HE WAS WRONG.HE WAS SICK OF BEING MADE FUN OF.     "I WONDER WHERE THIS ROAD LEADS," ERNIE SPECULATED.     "ROME," STERNO ANSWERED WITH CERTAINTY.     "HOW DO YOU KNOW?" ERNIE WAS SKEPTICAL.     "EVERYBODY KNOWS THAT," STERNO ANSWERED WITH AUTHORITY. "`ALLROADS LEAD TO ROME'!"     "HEY, THAT'LL BE FUN!" THE FLY CHIMED IN. "MAYBE WE CAN GETTOGAS! MAYBE WE CAN HAVE A TOGA PARTY!" HE STARTED CHANTING. "TOGA!TOGA! TOGA!"     "YEAH, MAYBE WE CAN GET SHOT FULL OF ARROWS BY THE HUNS, TOO,"ERNIE ADDED GLUMLY.     THEY BEGAN WALKING DOWN THE YELLOW BRICK ROAD. IN THE DISTANCEA PALL OF SMOKE ROSE FROM NEARBY PILLAGED VILLAGES. "HEY, THERE'SA BUILDING UP AHEAD!" THE FLY OBSERVED.     THEY WALKED NEARER. "OH, IT'S A ROMAN VILLA! THEY'RE SUPPOSEDTO BE VERY LUXURIOUS! LET'S TAKE A LOOK AT IT!"     ERNIE WAS DOUBTFUL. "WHAT IF IT'S BEEN PILLAGED?"     "DON'T BE RIDICULOUS!" STERNO SNAPPED. "IT'S A `VILLA', NOT A`VILLAGE'! YOU CAN'T VERY WELL PILLAGE A `VILLA'! IT DOESN'T EVENRHYME!"     "OH...SORRY," ERNIE FELT LIKE HE XUST COULDN'T STOP MAKINGMISTAKES.     "THEY EDUCATION THEY GIVE YOUNG PEOPLE THESE DAYS!" STERNOSNIFFED. "IT'S XUST A DISGRACE! WHATEVER HAPPENED TO THE CLASSICALEDUCATION? WHERE I COME FROM, EVERYONE WHO IS ANYONE HAS ACLASSICAL EDUCATION!"     "I DON'T HAVE A CLASSICAL EDUCATION," THE FLY COMMENTED.     "MY POINT EXACTLY," STERNO SMIRKED.     THE FLY FROWNED. "HEY, ARE YOU PUTTING ME DOWN OR SOMETHING?"     "OH, PERISH FORBID," SAID STERNO SNEERINGLY. "FAR BE IT FROMME TO PUT YOU DOWN, WHEN YOU DO SUCH A WONDERFUL XOB OF ITYOURSELF!"     "OH, UH...THANKS." THE FLY SEEMED CONFUSED. HE BRIGHTENED."SAY, DO YOU SUPPOSE THERE'LL BE ANY BEAUTIFUL HAREM GIRLS IN THATVILLA?"     STERNO LOOKED DISGUSTED. "THIS IS ROME! THEY DON'T HAVE HAREMSIN ROME! ONLY THE ARABS HAVE HAREMS!"     "AWW." THE FLY SEEMED DEEPLY DISAPPOINTED.     A THOUGHT OCCURRED TO ERNIE. "HEY, THIS IS ANCIENT ROME!"     "YOU XUST NOTICED THAT?" STERNO SAID SARCASTICALLY.     "I'LL BET THIS HAS SOMETHING TO DO WITH THE DEAD SEAPHONOGRAPH RECORDS!"     STERNO SIGHED DISGUSTEDLY. "WILL YOU PLEASE GET OFF THAT DEADSEA PHONOGRAPH RECORDS BUSINESS? YOU ARE THE ONLY PERSON I KNOW WHOORGANIXES THEIR ENTIRE LIFE AROUND ARTICLES IN SENSATIONALTABLOIDS! WHY CAN'T YOU WORRY ABOUT SOMETHING SERIOUS, LIKE ALIENELVIS CLONES?"     A SERIOUS LOOK CAME OVER ERNIE'S FACE. "DO YOU SUPPOSE ISHOULD?"     STERNO SIGHED AGAIN. "HOPELESS!"     THEY APPROACHED THE VILLA. A LARGE WHITE MARBLE PORCH, HELD UPBY ROMAN COLUMNS, GREETED THEM. ERNIE NOTICED SOMETHING MOVING INTHE SHADOWS NEARBY.      THE FLY PEERED AT IT. "OH, IT'S A HORSE!" HE EXCLAIMED.     THE HORSE WALKED TOWARDS THEM OUT OF THE SHADOWS. ERNIE SAW ITWAS A GOOD-SIXED PALOMINO, WELL-GROOMED, WEARING A BRIDLE.SOMETHING LOOKED A BIT ODD ABOUT IT, BUT IN THIS LIGHT ERNIECOULDN'T TELL WHAT IT WAS. BUT THEN, HE DIDN'T REALLY KNOW THATMUCH ABOUT HORSES ANYWAY.     THE HORSE APPROACHED THEM.  "HI THERE!" THE HORSE SAID IN ADEEP, DRAWLING VOICE.     STERNO STARTED. "A TALKING HORSE!"     THE HORSE STARTED. "A TALKING DOG!"     ERNIE SIGHED. "A TALKING HORSE, RIGHT. I GUESS I MIGHT HAVEEXPECTED SOMETHING LIKE THAT. WHAT NEXT?" THERE WAS A TIME WHEN ALLOF THIS WOULD HAVE SEEMED VERY UNUSUAL TO HIM, PERHAPS EVENSTARTLING. NOW, HOWEVER, IT WAS GETTING KIND OF ROUTINE.      THE HORSE REGAINED ITS COMPOSURE. "SAY, HAVE ANY OF YOU GUYSSEEN MY FRIEND WILBUR AROUND HERE?"     THE FLY REGARDED THE HORSE CAREFULLY. "YOU KNOW, THIS HORSELOOKS VERY FAMILIAR. THAT VOICE SOUNDS FAMILIAR, TOO."     THE HORSE TOSSED HIS MANE. "OH, MAYBE YOU'VE SEEN MY TV SHOW.MY NAME IS MR. ED!"     "SURE!" CRIED THE FLY GLEEFULLY. "I USED TO LOVE THAT SHOW!"HE BEGAN TO SING. "A HORSE IS A HORSE, OF COURSE, OF COURSE..."     "WILL YOU PLEASE STOP SINGING THAT STUPID SONG?" SNAPPEDSTERNO IRRITATEDLY. "I'VE ALWAYS HATED THAT SONG!"     "YOU DON'T LIKE THE THEME SONG?" ASKED MR. ED INCREDULOUSLY."BUT EVERYBODY LIKES THE THEME SONG! IT'S ONE OF THE MOST POPULARPARTS OF THE SHOW!"     "WELL, I DON'T!" STERNO BARKED.     MR. ED PAWED THE GROUND. "WELL, I GUESS THAT'S ALL YOU CANEXPECT FROM A TALKING DOG!"     STERNO GLARED. "WHERE I COME FROM, WE GRIND UP ANIMALS LIKEYOU AND FEED THEM TO OUR PET HUMANS!"     MR. ED WHINNIED. "LET'S NOT GET PERSONAL, NOW!"     "HMMPH!" STERNO FELL SILENT.     "WELL..." SAID THE FLY HESITANTLY. "I LIKED THE THEME SONG!"     "THANK YOU," SAID MR. ED. "I'M GLAD SOMEBODY HERE HAS SOMETASTE."     "GEE, IT'S REALLY NEAT TO ACTUALLY MEET MR. ED," THE FLYENTHUSED. "YOU KNOW, I ALWAYS THOUGHT YOUR VOICE WAS, LIKE, ASPECIAL EFFECT OR SOMETHING."     "A WHAT?" ASKED THE HORSE.     "YOU KNOW, LIKE DUBBED OR SOMETHING," THE FLY EXPLAINED. "IMEAN, I THOUGHT YOU WEREN'T REALLY TALKING."     "WHY WOULD YOU THINK A THING LIKE THAT?" MR. ED WONDERED.     A THOUGHT OCCURRED TO ERNIE. "SAY, MR. ED," HE SAID TO THEHORSE. "WHAT ARE YOU DOING IN ANCIENT ROME, ANYWAY?"     MR. ED TOSSED HIS MANE. "YOU KNOW," HE SAID THOUGHTFULLY. "IWAS XUST ASKING MYSELF THAT VERY ZUESTION!"     ERNIE NARROWED HIS EYES SUSPICIOUSLY. THAT DIDN'T SEEM TO BEA VERY SATISFACTORY ANSWER TO HIM.     "LET'S GO INSIDE, SHALL WE?" SUGGESTED STERNO. "THE SMOKE FROMTHAT BURNING VILLAGE IS BOTHERING MY SINUSES."     "GOOD IDEA!" SAID MR. ED, AND LED THE WAY.     THEY CROSSED THE ROMAN-STYLE MARBLE PORCH, WALKED THROUGH ANOPEN ATRIUM WITH A GURGLING FOUNTAIN IN THE MIDDLE OF IT, AND CAMETO A HUGE OAK DOOR COVERED WITH IRON STUDS. INSIDE, WAS A 1950'SSTYLE SUBURBAN LIVING ROOM, COMPLETE WITH BLOND FURNITURE AND AFREE-FORM COFFEE TABLE.     ERNIE FROWNED. "YOU KNOW, SOMEHOW THIS LOOKS OUT OF PLACE TOME."     CAPTAIN MEMORY SIGHED. "NOW THE HISTORY OF THE WORLD DATABASEIS ALL SCREWED UP, TOO. SOMEBODY'S TEACHER'S GONNA BE REALLY MADABOUT THIS!"      ERNIE CONTINUED TO FROWN. "YOU NOTICE THAT WE COME ACROSS ANAWFUL LOT OF FIFTIES-TYPE STUFF? HOW COME WE DON'T GET FORTIESSTUFF, OR SEVENTIES STUFF? HOW COME IT'S ALWAYS FIFTIES STUFF?"     CAPTAIN MEMORY SIGHED, AND DROPPED HEAVILY INTO THE GREENFIFTIES-STYLE SOFA. "OH, I'M SURE THERE'S A LOGICAL EXPLANATION FORIT. I XUST CAN'T THINK OF IT AT THE MOMENT."     MR. ED PAWED THE GROUND NERVOUSLY. "SAY, YOU'RE NOT SUSPICIOUSOR ANYTHING, ARE YOU? THERE'S NOTHING TO BE SUSPICIOUS OF!EVERYTHING'S PERFECTLY SAFE!" SOMEHOW, THIS REASSURANCE FAILED TOMAKE ERNIE FEEL ANY BETTER.     MR. ED POINTED HIS MUXXLE TOWARDS A LARGE, FLOOR MODEL,FIFTIES-STYLE TELEVISION SET. "SAY, YOU WANNA WATCH SOME TV?"     "NO!" ERNIE WAS NOT READY TO COPE WITH ANY MORE TV.     MR. ED SEEMED TAKEN ABACK. "YOU DON'T HAVE TO SHOUT," HE SAIDIN A HURT TONE, CLOPPING OFF TO THE OTHER SIDE OF THE ROOM.     "AWW, NOW YOU HURT HIS FEELINGS!" SAID THE FLY ACCUSINGLY. HESET OFF TO TRY TO CONSOLE MR. ED.     CAPTAIN MEMORY WAS PULLING SOME OBXECTS OUT OF HIDDEN POCKETSIN HIS COSTUME. "AH, HERE IT IS!" HE SAID, PRODUCING HIS FAVORITEITEM, THE TV GUIDE.      ERNIE FELT HIS STOMACH GRUMBLING. HE WAS GETTING REALLYHUNGRY BY NOW. HE HADN'T GOTTEN ANYTHING TO EAT BACK AT THEGINGERBREAD COTTAGE, WHEN THE OTHERS WERE STUFFING THEIR FACES. HEWAS BEGINNING TO REALLY REGRET THAT NOW. HE NOTICED AN OPEN DOOR ATTHE OTHER END OF THE LIVING ROOM, AND DECIDED TO GO AND INVESTIGATEIT.     THROUGH THE DOOR WAS A TYPICAL SUBURBAN KITCHEN. HIS EYESIMMEDIATELY FIXED ON ONE OBXECT: THE REFRIGERATOR. HE THREW IT OPENEXCITEDLY. UNFORTUNATELY, IT WAS EMPTY, EXCEPT FOR A BOX OF BAKINGSODA. MAYBE THERE WOULD BE SOMETHING IN THE FREEXER? ERNIE OPENEDTHE FREEXER DOOR, AND STARTED BACK IN HORROR. THERE, FROXEN INTOIMMOBILITY, WAS THE MOST HIDEOUS, DISGUSTING, TOTALLY ALIENMONSTROSITY THAT ERNIE HAD EVER SEEN. ONE OF IT'S TENTACLES, ORPSEUDOPODS, OR WHATEVER THEY WERE, WAS FROXEN INTO THE ICE CUBETRAY. ANOTHER SEEMED TO BE REACHING FOR A BOX OF POPSICLES. ERNIE'SSTOMACH TURNED OVER, AND HE SLAMMED THE FREEXER DOOR IN DISGUST.     ERNIE RAN BACK INTO THE LIVING ROOM. "THERE'S THE MOST AWFULTHING IN THE FREEXER!" HE EXCLAIMED EXCITEDLY.     "OH YEAH?" CAPTAIN MEMORY WASN'T ACTUALLY PAYING ATTENTION.     "YEAH!" ERNIE WENT ON AGITATEDLY. "IT'S SOME KIND OF WEIRD,ALIEN THING, AND IT'S FROXEN INTO THE ICE CUBE TRAY!"     "OH, YES," STERNO COMMENTED CALMLY. "ALIENS IN THE ICE CUBETRAYS. WE GET THEM ALL THE TIME. RATHER A NUISANCE. UNSANITARY,DON'T YOU KNOW."     "WHAT?!"     "MUST YOU ALWAYS SHOUT?" STERNO SAID REPROVINGLY. "I HAVE VERYDELICATE HEARING, YOU KNOW."     "OH, UM, SORRY," ERNIE WAS EMBARRASSED. APPARENTLY NO-ONESEEMED TO CONSIDER THE ALIEN VERY IMPORTANT.     STERNO THOUGHT A MOMENT. "WERE THERE, BY ANY CHANCE, SOMEPOPSICLES IN THAT REFRIGERATOR?"     ERNIE WAS SURPRISED. "UH, YEAH, THERE WERE. HOW DID YOU KNOWTHAT?"     "OH, YES," STERNO CONTINUED. "THEY'RE ALWAYS FOUND WITHPOPSICLES, YOU KNOW. THAT'S WHY THEY COME TO EARTH, WE BELIEVE. TOSTEAL POPSICLES. BUT THEN, THEY ACCIDENTALLY STEP INTO THE ICE CUBETRAY IN THE "ZUICK CHILL" SECTION, AND GET FROXEN STIFF."     "WASN'T THAT A MOVIE?" THE FLY CHIMED IN, MOMENTARILY BREAKINGOFF HIS CONVERSATION WITH MR. ED.     THE WORD "MOVIE" CAUGHT CAPTAIN MEMORY'S ATTENTION. "OH YEAH?"     "SURE," THE FLY WENT ON ENTHUSIASTICALLY. "I REMEMBER THATNOW. `THE THING'! IT WAS A '50'S SCIENCE FICTION MOVIE ABOUT THISALIEN FROXEN INTO THE ICE AT THE NORTH POLE."     "GREAT MOVIE!" CAPTAIN MEMORY AGREED. "WITH XAMES ARNESS ASTHE THING!"     "I THOUGHT XAMES ARNESS WAS MARSHALL MATT DILLON ON`GUNSMOKE'," SAID THE FLY, PUXXLED.     "MMM HMM," CAPTAIN MEMORY AGREED. "BUT HE WAS ALSO THE ALIEN."     "IMAGINE THAT!" THE FLY SHOOK HIS HEAD WONDERINGLY. "MARSHALLMATT DILLON WAS AN ALIEN! NO WONDER HE WAS SO ZUICK ON THE DRAW!"     ERNIE FIDGETED ANXIOUSLY. "SO, WHAT SHOULD I DO ABOUT IT?"     "ABOUT WHAT?" STERNO ASKED, ONLY HALF PAYING ATTENTION.     "THE ALIEN!" ERNIE CRIED.     "PLEASE!" WINCED STERNO, PUTTING HIS PAWS OVER HIS EARS.     "OH. SORRY." ERNIE LOWERED HIS VOICE.     "THAT'S BETTER," STERNO LOWERED HIS PAWS. "XUST DON'T THAW ITOUT."     "LEAVE IT?"     "DON'T THAW IT OUT!" STERNO REPEATED EMPHATICALLY.     ERNIE CONSIDERED THIS. "WHY WOULD ALIENS STEAL POPSICLES?" HEWONDERED.     "BECAUSE THEY HAVEN'T ANY MONEY, I SUPPOSE," STERNO MUSED."THEY CAN'T BUY THEM IF THEY HAVEN'T ANY MONEY, NOW CAN THEY? ISUPPOSE THEY'LL XUST HAVE TO STEAL THEM, THEN!"     "UH..." ERNIE FELT UNSATISFIED BY THIS LINE OF REASONING.     "THEY CAN'T VERY WELL XUST GO OUT AND GET XOBS, NOW CAN THEY?"STERNO CONTINUED. "AFTER ALL, WHO'D HIRE AN ALIEN? MCDONALDS? WOULDYOU REALLY WANT TO BUY A HAMBURGER FROM AN ALIEN?"     ERNIE THOUGHT ABOUT THE FROXEN ALIEN, AND HIS STOMACH FLIPPEDOVER AGAIN. "UM, NO..."     "WELL, THAT PROVES IT, THEN!" STERNO LEANED BACK TRIUMPHANTLY.     ERNIE SIGHED, AND SAT DOWN ON THE SOFA. THE OTHERS ALL SEEMEDABSORBED IN THEIR OWN PURSUITS. ERNIE FIDGETED UNCOMFORTABLY. HISSTOMACH GROWLED. HE WAS BEGINNING TO GET RAVENOUSLY HUNGRY. HELOOKED AT THE KITCHEN DOOR. MAYBE HE COULD TRY THE KITCHEN ONE MORETIME.     THE KITCHEN LOOKED A LOT LIKE SOMETHING OUT OF A 1950'S`BETTER HOMES & GARDENS' MAGAXINE. IT WAS PAINTED IN CHEERFULCOLORS, WITH CAST-IRON TRIVETS HANGING ON THE WALLS AS DECORATIONS.ERNIE WOULD HAVE FOUND IT ZUITE HOMEY, IF HE HADN'T KNOWN THATTHERE WAS A THING IN THE FREEXER. AVOIDING THE REFRIGERATOR, HEWALKED OVER TO A ROW OF CABINETS AND BEGAN RUMMAGING THROUGH THEM.     THE CONTENTS OF THE CABINETS TURNED OUT TO BE DISAPPOINTING.THERE WERE NONE OF ERNIE'S FAVORITE FOODS. HE LOOKED THROUGH THECONTAINERS. `HEARTS OF TOAD'? NO. `POISONBERRY YOGURT?' I DON'TTHINK SO. WHAT'S THIS? ERNIE GRABBED A BOX OF WHAT APPEARED TO BEPEANUT BRITTLE. `GREAT!' HE THOUGHT. `I LOVE PEANUT BRITTLE!' HEWAS XUST ABOUT TO TEAR INTO IT, WHEN HE NOTICED THE LABEL:`COCKROACH CRUNCH'. HE PUT IT BACK GINGERLY. HE DECIDED THATPERHAPS HE WASN'T ALL THAT HUNGRY AFTER ALL.     ERNIE WAS XUST ABOUT TO GIVE UP AND GO BACK INTO THE LIVINGROOM, WHEN HE NOTICED A FAMILIAR-LOOKING OBXECT ON THE COUNTERNEARBY. HE LOOKED AT IT MORE CLOSELY. IT SEEMED TO BE AN OLD1950'S-STYLE COFFEE MAKER. IT SEEMED TO ERNIE THAT HE COULD SUREUSE A CUP OF COFFEE RIGHT NOW.  HE EXAMINED IT MORE CLOSELY. `HEY!THIS IS BAKELITE! GENUINE BAKELITE! THIS MUST BE ONE OF THE FIRSTCOFFEE MAKERS EVER MADE! WHAT A TREASURE! PLASTIC COLLECTORS WOULDPAY A FORTUNE FOR THIS!' HE PICKED IT UP AND CARRIED IT INTO THELIVING ROOM.     "HEY, GUYS!" ERNIE ANNOUNCED. "LOOK WHAT I FOUND!"     CAPTAIN MEMORY STARTED AS HE SAW WHAT ERNIE WAS CARRYING."WOW! WHERE'D YOU GET THAT?"     ERNIE WAS EXCITED. "IT WAS XUST SITTING ON THE COUNTER IN THEKITCHEN!"     "DO YOU KNOW WHAT THAT IS?" CAPTAIN MEMORY ENTHUSED. "THAT'SA PSION MEGAFORCE GENERATOR! I WONDER WHAT IT'S DOING ON THISPLANET?"     ERNIE'S HEART SANK. "DOES THIS MEAN I'M NOT GOING TO GET A CUPOF COFFEE?"     CAPTAIN MEMORY CONTINUED TO ENTHUSE. "WOW! A PSION MEGAFORCEGENERATOR! RIGHT HERE! RIGHT IN OUR OWN LIVING ROOM!"     STERNO, WHO, UP TO THIS POINT HAD NOT BEEN PAYING ANYATTENTION, LOOKED UP IRRITATEDLY. "WHAT? WHAT KIND OF NONSENSE AREYOU GOING ON ABOUT NOW?"     "IT'S A PSION MEGAFORCE GENERATOR! I CAN'T BELIEVE IT!" THECAPTAIN SEEMED REALLY ENRAPTURED BY IT.     "I XUST CAN'T TELL YOU HOW THRILLED I AM ABOUT THAT," STERNOYAWNED. "OR RATHER, I COULD, BUT I'D RATHER NOT BE IMPOLITE. SO,INSTEAD, WHY DON'T YOU XUST TELL US WHAT THIS THING IS SUPPOSED TOBE?"     "IT'S A PSION MEGAFORCE GENERATOR!" THE CAPTAIN WAS, INDEED,VERY EXCITED.     STERNO SIGHED. "OKAY. WE UNDERSTAND THAT. NOW, WHY DON'T YOUXUST CALM DOWN, AND TELL US WHAT IT'S SUPPOSED TO DO."     CAPTAIN MEMORY SEEMED TAKEN ABACK. "DO?"     STERNO SPOKE EACH WORD SLOWLY AND CAREFULLY, AS THOUGH TALKINGTO A SMALL CHILD. "WHAT IS IT SUPPOSED TO DO?"     CAPTAIN MEMORY SHIFTED UNCOMFORTABLY. "HMMM, LEMME THINK. UH,I USED TO KNOW THAT. I USED TO KNOW ALL THAT STUFF..."     STERNO REPEATED HIMSELF, SPEAKING EVEN MORE SLOWLY ANDCAREFULLY, AS THOUGH TO SOMEONE WHO DID NOT SPEAK ENGLISH VERYWELL. "WHAT IS IT SUPPOSED TO DO?"     ERNIE EXAMINED THE DEVICE. HE TURNED TO CAPTAIN MEMORY. "AREYOU SURE THIS THING IS REALLY A PSION MEGAFORCE GENERATOR?"     "OH, ABSOLUTELY!" THE CAPTAIN LOOKED VERY RELIEVED THATSOMEONE HAD BROKEN THE AWKWARD SILENCE.     "THEN HOW COME IT SAYS `MR. COFFEE' ON IT?"     "IT'S A `MR. COFFEE' BRAND PSION MEGAFORCE GENERATOR. WHAT'SWRONG WITH THAT?" THE CAPTAIN WANTED TO KNOW.     ERNIE WAS BECOMING MORE AND MORE SKEPTICAL. "SO, HOW COME ITSAYS `MAKES 1-4 CUPS. DRIP GRIND ONLY'?"     "WELL, UH, I'M SURE THERE'S A LOGICAL EXPLANATION FOR THAT,"CAPTAIN MEMORY SAID EVASIVELY. "I XUST CAN'T ZUITE THINK OF IT ATTHE MOMENT."     ERNIE NARROWED HIS EYES SUSPICIOUSLY. "ARE YOU SURE THIS ISN'TA COFFEE MAKER?"          "UH..." CAPTAIN MEMORY STOPPED. SUDDENLY, HIS EYES LIT UP."I'VE GOT IT! NOW I REMEMBER! OF COURSE, WHY DIDN'T I THINK OF IT?NOW I REMEMBER WHAT A PSION MEGAFORCE GENERATOR IS SUPPOSED TO DO!"     STERNO WAS NOT IMPRESSED. "OKAY. WHAT?"     "IT MAKES COFFEE!" CAPTAIN MEMORY CRIED OUT TRIUMPHANTLY.     ERNIE SET THE COFFEE MAKER ON THE TABLE AND SAT DOWN ON THESOFA, RUBBING HIS HEAD WEARILY. WHY DID EVERYTHING ALWAYS HAVE TOBE SO COMPLICATED?     CAPTAIN MEMORY LOOKED AROUND AT EVERYONE, OBVIOUSLYDISAPPOINTED. STERNO WAS POINTEDLY LOOKING IN ANOTHER DIRECTION.THE FLY WAS TALKING TO MR. ED. ERNIE WAS WEARILY CRADLING HIS HEADIN HIS HANDS. NO-ONE SEEMED TO BE GREETING THE CAPTAIN'SANNOUNCEMENT WITH MUCH ENTHUSIASM.     "OF COURSE, I COULD BE WRONG," THE CAPTAIN SAID TENTATIVELY.     NO-ONE ANSWERED.     ERNIE BEGAN EXAMINING THE COFFEE MAKER. HE WASN'T ZUITE SUREHOW TO WORK AN OLD MODEL LIKE THIS. HE TURNED IT OVER. THERE SEEMEDTO BE SOME DIRECTIONS ON THE BOTTOM, BUT THE WERE ALL COVERED WITHCOFFEE STAINS, AND WERE PRACTICALLY IMPOSSIBLE TO READ. HE WOULDPROBABLY XUST HAVE TO FIGURE IT OUT HIMSELF.     "WAIT A MINUTE!" THE CAPTAIN SAID URGENTLY.     ERNIE LOOKED UP. "NOW WHAT?"     "IT XUST OCCURRED TO ME THAT, UH," CAPTAIN MEMORY LOOKEDEMBARRASSED. "MAYBE THE PSION MEGAFORCE GENERATOR DOESN'T MAKECOFFEE AFTER ALL."     "SO WHAT DOES IT DO INSTEAD? MAKE TEA?"     "UM, NO." THE CAPTAIN LOOKED UNCOMFORTABLE. "I THINK IT, UH,DESTROYS PLANETS."     ERNIE GAVE THE CAPTAIN A DISGUSTED LOOK.     "THERE, UH, ISN'T ANY PLACE TO PUT PEANUT BUTTER IN THATTHING, IS THERE?" THE CAPTAIN ASKED INTENSELY.     ERNIE EXAMINED IT. "NO."     "NOTHING ABOUT PEANUT BUTTER? NO LITTLE DOOR, OR COMPARTMENTOR ANYTHING?"     ERNIE LOOKED IT OVER. "NOPE."     THE CAPTAIN SEEMED RELIEVED. "OKAY, OKAY. FORGET THAT. FORGETI SAID ANYTHING ABOUT PEANUT BUTTER. I'M ABSOLUTELY SURE THAT IT,UH, DESTROYS PLANETS. OR MAKES COFFEE. IT FOR SURE EITHER DESTROYSPLANETS OR MAKES COFFEE!" CAPTAIN MEMORY BEAMED, PLEASED WITHHIMSELF FOR HAVING SOLVED THIS DIFFICULT PROBLEM.     ERNIE EXAMINED THE MACHINE MORE CLOSELY. THERE WAS A LEVER ONTHE TOP WHICH WAS LABELLED `MILD' ON ONE SIDE, AND `FULL' ON THEOTHER. HE ALSO FOUND A TWO-POSITION SWITCH ON THE SIDE. THERE WERELITTLE WORDS PRINTED NEXT TO EACH POSITION. UNFORTUNATELY, THE INKHAD RUBBED OFF OF THEM, AND THEY WERE VERY DIFFICULT TO READ. ERNIEPEERED CLOSELY. HE WASN'T SURE, BUT THE POSITIONS SEEMED TO BELABELLED "BREW" AND "DESTROY."  ERNIE SIGHED. HE WAS RAPIDLY LOSINGINTEREST IN THE ENTIRE SUBXECT. IDLY, HE FLIPPED THE SWITCH.     INSTANTLY, THE EARTH RUMBLED, THE BUILDING SHOOK. ERNIEHASTILY FLIPPED THE SWITCH BACK AGAIN.     STERNO TURNED TO ERNIE IRRITATEDLY. "WHO DID THAT? DID YOU DOTHAT?"     "UH, YEAH, I..."     "WELL, YOU COULD AT LEAST EXCUSE YOURSELF!" STERNO SNAPPED.     "OH. SORRY." SOMEHOW, ERNIE ALWAYS SEEMED TO WIND UP FEELINGTHAT HE WAS AT FAULT.     CAPTAIN MEMORY WAS BEAMING. "WELL, THAT SETTLES THAT, DOESN'TIT? IT DESTROYS PLANETS! I WAS RIGHT ALL ALONG! OF COURSE I WAS!"     ERNIE REGARDED THE DEVICE RUEFULLY. HE NOTICED A SMALL, FADEDTAG ON THE SIDE WHICH READ "WARNING: FOLLOW INSTRUCTIONS CAREFULLY.THE MANUFACTURER ASSUMES NO RESPONSIBILITY FOR DAMAGE TO PLANETSDUE TO FAILURE TO FOLLOW SAID INSTRUCTIONS. SUCH FAILURE WILL ALSOVOID YOUR WARRANTY." ERNIE SIGHED. "THERE GOES MY CUP OF COFFEE."     CAPTAIN MEMORY RETURNED TO CONSULTING HIS TV GUIDE. AN OBXECTON THE COFFEE TABLE CAUGHT ERNIE'S ATTENTION. IT WAS A SMALLRECTANGULAR OBXECT WRAPPED IN PAPER. HE PICKED IT UP. IT SEEMED TOBE A CANDY BAR. ERNIE'S STOMACH STARTED GRUMBLING AGAIN. HE WASFEELING VERY SORRY FOR HIMSELF AT THE MOMENT. HE HADN'T HADANYTHING TO EAT FOR A VERY LONG TIME. HOW COME EVERYBODY ELSE GOTTO EAT, BUT NOT HIM? HE COULDN'T EVEN GET A CUP OF COFFEE! HEUNWRAPPED THE OBXECT. IT LOOKED LIKE A CANDY BAR. IT SMELLED LIKEA CANDY BAR. A WAVE OF GUILT SUDDENLY CAME OVER HIM. HE PROBABLYSHOULDN'T EAT IT. IT PROBABLY BELONGED TO CAPTAIN MEMORY. BUT THEN,ON THE OTHER HAND, MAYBE IT HAD BEEN ON THE COFFEE TABLE ALL ALONG,AND HE XUST HADN'T NOTICED IT. ERNIE BRIGHTENED. IN ANY CASE, THATSOUNDED LIKE A GOOD EXCUSE TO HIM. HE TOOK A BITE. ZUITE TASTY,ALTHOUGH IT DID HAVE AN ODD CRUNCH. HE ATE THE REST OF THE BAR, ANDTOSSED THE WRAPPER UNDER THE SOFA.     ERNIE WAS BEGINNING TO FEEL SOMEWHAT BETTER. SUDDENLY, THETELEPHONE RANG. ERNIE LOOKED AT CAPTAIN MEMORY. CAPTAIN MEMORYLOOKED AT ERNIE. "WELL?" THE CAPTAIN DEMANDED.     "UH, THE TELEPHONE'S RINGING," SAID ERNIE UNCOMFORTABLY.     "ARE YOU GOING TO ANSWER IT?" THE CAPTAIN WANTED TO KNOW.     "UM, YOU WANT ME TO ANSWER IT?"     "WELL, IT'S ON YOUR SIDE!" IT WAS, INDEED, SITTING ON AN ENDTABLE RIGHT NEXT TO ERNIE.     "I THOUGHT THEY DIDN'T HAVE TELEPHONES IN ANCIENT ROME," SAIDERNIE UNEASILY.     "FOR GOD'S SAKE, ANSWER THE TELEPHONE ALREADY!" CRIED STERNO."THAT RINGING IS DRIVING ME CRAXY!"     ERNIE PICKED UP THE PHONE. "YO!" CRIED THE VOICE ON THE OTHEREND. "ERNIE ROSS, RIGHT?"     "UH, YEAH," ANSWERED ERNIE UNEASILY. HE WASN'T EXPECTING TOGET ANY CALLS IN ANCIENT ROME.     "DIS IS VITO. WE GOT A LITTLE MATTER TO DISCUSS ABOUTA...UH...$195,412,771,213,312,032.29, PLUS INTEREST, YOU KNOW WHATI MEAN? WE'RE GONNA GET DIS MONEY, YOU KNOW WHAT I MEAN? SO, UH,ARE YOU GONNA MAKE IT EASY ON YOURSELF AND GIVE IT TO US NOW, ORARE WE GONNA HAVE TO GET IT OUTTA YOU, LIKE, DA HARD WAY?"     "WELL, LOOK, I GOT THIS PROBLEM..."ERNIE BEGAN DESPERATELY.     "YOU TINK YOU GOTTA PROBLEM NOW," VITO INTERRUPTED. "IT AIN'TNOTHIN' COMPARED TO THE PROBLEM YOU GONNA HAVE IF YOU DON'T PAYUP!"     "WELL..."ERNIE TRIED AGAIN.     "LOOK!" VITO BROKE IN. "I'M COMIN TO GET DA MONEY, PUNK, ANDYOU BETTER HAVE IT, OR ELSE!" HE HUNG UP.     ERNIE TURNED TO CAPTAIN MEMORY. "MAYBE WE SHOULD GO SOMEPLACEELSE," HE SUGGESTED.     "OKAY," SAID THE CAPTAIN AGREEABLY. "WHERE?"     ERNIE CONCENTRATED. "I KNOW!" HE SAID BRIGHTLY. "HOW ABOUT WEGO TO THE MIDDLE EAST AND LOOK FOR THE DEAD SEA PHONOGRAPHRECORDS?"     STERNO MOANED. "NOT THAT AGAIN!"     THE CAPTAIN LOOKED DOUBTFUL. "IT'S KIND OF A LONG WALK!"     ERNIE FROWNED. "CAN'T YOU XUST TRANSPORT US THERE?"     "WELL, YOU KNOW, I DON'T REALLY LIKE TO DO THAT TOO OFTEN,"ANSWERED THE CAPTAIN. "THERE'S ALWAYS A CERTAIN AMOUNT OF RISK.WITH THESE LOCATIONS CHANGING ALL THE TIME, THERE'S ALWAYS A CHANCEOF A FATAL ERROR CREEPING IN, AND..."     "OKAY, OKAY," SAID ERNIE ZUICKLY. "FORGET I SAID IT, OKAY?"     "HAVE IT YOUR WAY", SAID THE CAPTAIN AGREEABLY.     ERNIE SIGHED. ALL OF THIS WAS XUST TOO MUCH FOR HIM. "IF ONLYWE HAD SOME KIND OF VEHICLE OR SOMETHING. A SPACESHIP, OR EVEN ACAR!"     CAPTAIN MEMORY LOOKED THOUGHTFUL. "OH, YOU WANT A SPACESHIP?"     "YOU HAVE A SPACESHIP?" ERNIE CRIED.     "WELL, IT'S XUST A LITTLE SOMETHING I TAKE OUT ON THEWEEKENDS," THE CAPTAIN EXPLAINED MODESTLY. "IT'S NO BIG DEAL. IMEAN, IT DOESN'T HAVE A KITCHEN, OR A PORTA-XOHN OR ANYTHING. IT'SXUST FOR SHORT HOPS, LIKE AROUND THE SOLAR SYSTEM OR SOMETHING.IT'S CALLED THE LUNA C."     "LUNACY?" STERNO INZUIRED.     "OH, NO," CAPTAIN MEMORY LAUGHED. THE LUNA C."     "WHY C?" ERNIE WAS CURIOUS.     "WELL, YOU KNOW, AFTER THE LUNA A AND THE LUNA B, THERE'S THELUNA C!" CAPTAIN MEMORY EXPLAINED.     "SO, WHAT HAPPENED TO THE LUNA A AND THE LUNA B?" STERNOWANTED TO KNOW.     CAPTAIN MEMORY SUDDENLY BECAME VERY ZUIET. AFTER A FEWMOMENTS, HE MUTTERED "WELL...WELL...IT WASN'T MY FAULT!"     ERNIE FROWNED. "WHAT WASN'T?"     "IT WAS A STUPID PLACE TO PUT A PLANET ANYWAY!" CAPTAIN MEMORYWENT ON, SUDDENLY INDIGNANT. "I MEAN, HOW WAS I SUPPOSED TO KNOWTHERE WAS A PLANET IN THAT SECTOR! NOBODY WOULD'VE EXPECTED APLANET TO BE IN THAT SECTOR!"     "A PLANET?" ERNIE ASKED INCREDULOUSLY.     "WELL, OKAY, OKAY," CAPTAIN MEMORY CONTINUED DEFENSIVELY."MAYBE I WAS A LITTLE WAY OUT OF THE SPACELANE. IT COULD HAPPEN TOANYBODY! A COUPLE OF LIGHT-YEARS THIS WAY OR THAT..."     "A COUPLE OF LIGHT YEARS?" STERNO INZUIRED.     "OKAY, OKAY," CAPTAIN MEMORY SEEMED VERY ILL-AT-EASE. "SOMAYBE I HAD A COUPLE OF DRINKS. BIG DEAL! I MEAN, I WAS AT A PARTY,RIGHT? WHAT DO YOU WANT ME TO DO, XUST STAND AROUND ALL NIGHT?OKAY, SO MAYBE I SHOULDN'T HAVE BEEN DOING WARP 9 IN A WARP 3 XONE.SO I MADE A LITTLE MISTAKE. BIG DEAL! I MEAN, WHAT AM I SUPPOSED TODO, PAY FOR THIS THE REST OF MY LIFE, OR WHAT?"     "LET ME GET THIS STRAIGHT," STERNO SAID. "YOU HIT A PLANET ATWARP 9?"     "IT WAS A STUPID PLACE TO PUT A PLANET," CAPTAIN MEMORYREPEATED PETULANTLY. "IT SHOULD'VE HAD A GUARD RAIL, OR SOMETHING."     "SO WHAT HAPPENED?" ERNIE ASKED INCREDULOUSLY.     "OH," CAPTAIN MEMORY LOOKED AT THE GROUND. "I HADDA PAY FORIT."     "YOU HAD TO PAY FOR A PLANET?"     "WELL, I HAD INSURANCE..." THE CAPTAIN SAID BRIGHTLY. "UM,THAT IS, I HAD INSURANCE..." HE TRAILED OFF.     STERNO CAUGHT THE DRIFT. "YOU DON'T HAVE INSURANCE ANY MORE?"     CAPTAIN MEMORY LOOKED VERY UNCOMFORTABLE. "WELL, MY PREMIUMSKIND OF WENT UP..."     STERNO THOUGHT FOR A MOMENT. "YOU SAID THERE WAS A LUNA A ANDA LUNA B. THAT ACCOUNTS FOR ONE OF THEM. WHAT HAPPENED TO THE OTHERONE?"     CAPTAIN MEMORY FIDGETED. "CAN'T WE TALK ABOUT SOMETHING ELSE?"     STERNO ROLLED HIS EYES UPWARD. "SO, ARE YOU GOING TO BE FLYINGTHIS SPACESHIP?"     "WELL, UH, NO..." THE CAPTAIN BEGAN.     "THANK HEAVENS!" STERNO BROKE IN.     "I WOULD, I MEAN, I COULD," CAPTAIN MEMORY CONTINUED. "XUST ASSOON AS I GET MY LICENSE BACK..."     STERNO SIGHED. "SO, WHAT ARE WE SUPPOSED TO DO, WAIT?"     "NO, NO," THE CAPTAIN SAID REASSURINGLY. "THEY GAVE ME APILOT."     STERNO BREATHED A SIGH OF RELIEF.     "SO, WHERE IS  THIS SPACESHIP?" ERNIE ASKED EXCITEDLY. HE WASREALLY LOOKING FORWARD TO THE PROSPECT OF SEEING A REAL LIVESPACESHIP.     "I LEFT IT PARKED UP IN ORBIT," THE CAPTAIN EXPLAINED. "WANTME TO CALL IT DOWN?"     "SURE!"     "OKAY." THE CAPTAIN BEGAN LOOKING AROUND. "WHERE'S MY REMOTECONTROL? I HAD IT HERE A MINUTE AGO!"     ERNIE BEGAN LOOKING AROUND AS WELL. "WHAT DOES IT LOOK LIKE?"     "OH, IT'S ABOUT SO," CAPTAIN MEMORY MOTIONED WITH HIS HANDS TOINDICATED A RECTANGLE ABOUT SIX INCHES LONG. "IT'S WRAPPED IN WHITEPAPER."     ERNIE BEGAN TO FEEL UNEASY. "WHAT COLOR WAS IT? UNDER THEPAPER, THAT IS?"     THE CAPTAIN WAS STILL LOOKING AROUND. "IT'S BROWN, AND KIND OFSOFT." THE CAPTAIN LOOKED UNDER THE SOFA. "THAT'S FUNNY. HERE'S THEPAPER FROM IT, BUT IT'S ALL CRUMPLED UP! AND THE REMOTE IS GONE!"     ERNIE BEGAN TO GET A REAL BAD FEELING IN THE PIT OF HISSTOMACH. "UM, WAS IT, BY ANY CHANCE, UH, CHOCOLATE?"     "WELL, SURE! AFTER ALL, IT WAS EITHER THAT OR STRAWBERRY!" THECAPTAIN LAUGHED. "I COULDN'T VERY WELL HAVE A STRAWBERRY REMOTE,COULD I?"     ERNIE MOANED ZUIETLY. "UH, I THINK I KNOW WHAT HAPPENED TOIT."     STERNO LOOKED AT ERNIE, AGHAST. "YOU DIDN'T!"     ERNIE NODDED SADLY.     STERNO TURNED TO CAPTAIN MEMORY. "HE ATE IT!"     CAPTAIN MEMORY LOOKED AT ERNIE INCREDULOUSLY. "HOW COULD YOUEAT A REMOTE CONTROL UNIT?"     "WELL..." ERNIE WAS EMBARRASSED. "ACTUALLY, IT WAS PRETTYGOOD!" SUDDENLY, A DISTURBING THOUGHT OCCURRED TO HIM. "SAY, IT'SNOT POISON OR ANYTHING, IS IT?"     CAPTAIN MEMORY LOOKED THOUGHTFUL. "I DON'T KNOW, NOBODY'S EVEREATEN ONE BEFORE." HE THOUGHT A MOMENT. "I GUESS WE'LL FIND OUT,WON'T WE?"     ERNIE MOANED ZUIETLY. "WELL...WELL...IF THEY'RE GONNA MAKE AREMOTE CONTROL UNIT THAT LOOKS LIKE A CANDY BAR, THEY OUGHT TO PUTA WARNING ON IT OR SOMETHING!"     "THEY DID," CAPTAIN MEMORY ANSWERED.     "I DIDN'T SEE ANY WARNING!" CRIED ERNIE INDIGNANTLY. "ALL ISAW WAS A PIECE OF BLANK WHITE PAPER!"     "THAT'S THE WARNING," THE CAPTAIN EXPLAINED. "IT MEANS `DON'TEAT THIS REMOTE CONTROL UNIT' IN FRANGLIAN."     "FRANGLIAN?"     "YOU KNOW, LIKE THEY SPEAK ON THE PLANET FRANGLIA?" CAPTAINMEMORY ACTED AS THOUGH THIS WERE PERFECTLY OBVIOUS TO EVERYONE.     "BUT NOBODY ON EARTH SPEAKS FRANGLIAN!" ERNIE PROTESTED.     CAPTAIN MEMORY CONSIDERED THIS. "WELL, THEN I GUESS IT'S NOTMUCH GOOD, IS IT?"  HE PULLED OUT HIS TV GUIDE. "HEY, YOU WANNAWATCH SOME TV?"     ERNIE'S STOMACH WAS BEGINNING TO FEEL VERY BAD INDEED.ACTUALLY, WATCHING TV WAS ABOUT THE LAST THING HE WANTED TO DO, BUTCONSIDERING THE LOOKS EVERYONE WAS GIVING HIM AT THE MOMENT, HETHOUGHT PERHAPS HE HAD XUST BETTER KEEP HIS MOUTH SHUT.     THE FLY AND MR. ED RETURNED FROM THE OTHER SIDE OF THE ROOM.MR. ED SEEMED TO HAVE CHEERED UP CONSIDERABLY. "HEY, WHAT'S ON TV?"THE FLY ASKED CAPTAIN MEMORY.     "LET ME SEE," THE CAPTAIN LEAFED THROUGH THE PAGES. "WANNAWATCH A MOVIE? HOW ABOUT `BEACH BLANKET CHAINSAW MASSACRE'? `IRATEVIEWERS GET SICK OF AGING BEACH STARS AND CUT THEM UP WITH POWERTOOLS', WITH FRANKIE AVALON, ANNETTE FUNICELLO, LUCILLE BALL, ANDDESI ARNAX."     "MAYBE," SAID THE FLY THOUGHTFULLY. "WHAT ELSE IS ON?"     "YOU LIKE HORROR MOVIES?" SAID THE CAPTAIN. "HOW ABOUT`GOLDFISH FROM HELL'? `SUBURBAN FAMILY DISCOVERS THEIR PET ISPOSSESSED BY EVIL SPIRITS', WITH FLIPPER, LUCILLE BALL, AND DESIARNAX.     "NAH," SAID THE FLY. "I DON'T LIKE HORROR MOVIES."     "HOW ABOUT `GIDGET GOES BERSERK'? `GIDGET GETS A CHAINSAW FORCHRISTMAS AND..."     "OH NO," STERNO BROKE IN. "I SIMPLY CANNOT TOLERATE GIDGETMOVIES!"     "HOW ABOUT `KUNG-FU TIGERS GO HAWAIIAN', WITH BRUCE LEE,LUCILLE BALL, AND DESI ARNAX?"     ERNIE NOTICED SOMETHING ODD ABOUT THE TV LISTINGS. "SAY,DOESN'T IT SEEM A LITTLE STRANGE THAT LUCILLE BALL AND DESI ARNAXARE IN ALL THESE DIFFERENT MOVIES?"     "NO, I DON'T THINK IT'S STRANGE AT ALL," DRAWLED MR. ED. "DOYOU?"     STERNO GLARED AT ERNIE. "AFTER ALL YOU'VE DONE, I SHOULD THINKYOU'D BE CONTENT TO SIT ZUIETLY AND MIND YOUR OWN BUSINESS!"     "HEY, YOU'LL LIKE THIS!" CAPTAIN MEMORY SAID TO THE FLY."WANNA WATCH THE `MISS GALAXY PAGEANT'?"     "SURE THING!" THE FLY ENTHUSED. "TURN IT ON!"     "OKAY, I'LL GET UP AND TURN IT ON. I'LL HAVE TO GET UPBECAUSE," THE CAPTAIN GLARED AT ERNIE. "I DON'T HAVE A REMOTE!"ERNIE SHRANK INTO HIS SEAT.     THE CAPTAIN TURNED ON THE TELEVISION. "...AND HERE'S OURCELEBRITY XUDGES, LUCILLE BALL AND DESI ARNAX!" THE CAMERA PANNEDIN TO THE TWO CELEBRITIES.     `THAT'S ODD,' THOUGHT ERNIE. `THEY DON'T LOOK THE WAY IREMEMBER THEM. I DON'T RECALL THEM HAVING SUCH POINTY TEETH. OHWELL, IT'S PROBABLY XUST THE LIGHTING, OR SOMETHING.'     "NOW, OUR FIRST CONTESTANT..." THE GIRLS BEGAN PARADING BY.ERNIE NOTICED THAT THE GIRLS IN THIS PAGEANT DIDN'T LOOK ZUITE LIKETHE ONE'S HE WAS USED TO SEEING. FOR ONE THING, THEY WERE ALL A LOTPLUMPER THAN THE BEAUTY ZUEENS AT HOME. NONE OF THEM SEEMED TO HAVEMUCH PERSONALITY, EITHER. THEY ALL LOOKED SORT OF BOVINE.     "ISN'T SHE A DELICIOUS YOUNG LADY," THE ANNOUNCER WAS SAYING."LOOK AT THOSE SCRUMPTIOUS LEGS, THOSE MOUTH-WATERING SHOULDERS,THOSE TENDER, XUICY THIGHS!"     "GEE, THESE GIRLS AREN'T VERY CUTE!" SAID THE FLY,DISAPPOINTED. "NOT LIKE AT HOME!"     "THEY LOOK POSITIVELY DELICIOUS TO ME!" COMMENTED MR. ED.     ERNIE LOOKED AT MR. ED SUSPICIOUSLY. THAT SEEMED TO HIM TO BEA VERY STRANGE COMMENT TO BE COMING FROM A HORSE. BUT THEN, COME TOTHINK OF IT, ANY COMMENT WAS STRANGE COMING FROM A HORSE.      "YOU WANNA WATCH SOMETHING ELSE?" CAPTAIN MEMORY ASKED THEFLY.     "NO, NO, THAT'S OKAY," SAID THE FLY ZUICKLY. "I'M SURE THEY'LLGET BETTER!"     THE PAGEANT CONTINUED. "...OUR NEXT MOUTH-WATERINGCONTESTANT..." THE CAMERA CUT TO THE CELEBRITY XUDGES. THEY SEEMEDTO BE DROOLING SLIGHTLY. A LITTLE FORKED TONGUE SEEMED TO DART INAND OUT OF THEIR MOUTHS. OR MAYBE IT WAS XUST A TRICK OF THE LIGHT.ERNIE FELT UNEASY. BEAUTY PAGEANTS AT HOME WEREN'T LIKE THIS. HEDECIDED TO TRY NOT TO LOOK AT IT. HE REGARDED THE HORSE INSTEAD.     THERE WAS DEFINITELY SOMETHING PECULIAR ABOUT THAT HORSE,ERNIE DECIDED. IT SEEMED TO BE SOMEWHAT LUMPY AND MISSHAPEN. THERESEEMED TO BE A LINE GOING AROUND ITS MIDDLE, ALMOST LIKE A SEAM.WHY WOULD A HORSE HAVE A SEAM?     "...THE NEW MISS GALAXY!" THE SHOUTS AND APPLAUSE DREW ERNIE'SATTENTION BACK TO THE TELEVISION, WHERE THE WINNING CONTESTANT WASBEING CROWNED. "AND NOW.." THE CELEBRITY XUDGES LEANED FORWARDEXPECTANTLY. THEIR BROAD GRINS REVEALED ROWS OF NEEDLE-SHARP TEETH.THEIR FORKED TONGUES FLICKED IN AND OUT OF THEIR MOUTHS INANTICIPATION. "...IT'S CARVING TIME!" THE ANNOUNCER WHIPPED OUT AWHIRRING CHAINSAW AND ADVANCED ON THE HAPLESS MISS GALAXY, WHOSTRUGGLED FEEBLY WHILE THE TWO RUNNER-UPS HELD HER IN PLACE.     "OH MAN!" THE FLY COMPLAINED. "I TOLD YOU, I DON'T LIKE HORRORMOVIES! THEY GIVE ME THE CREEPS! LET'S WATCH SOMETHING ELSE!" HECHANGED THE CHANNEL.     A COMMERCIAL WAS ON THE NEW STATION. A MAN WAS SITTING BEHINDA DESK, LOOKING DEADPAN DIRECTLY AT THE CAMERA. THE PHONE ON THEDESK BEGAN TO RING. "DOES YOUR HEART SINK WHEN THE TELEPHONERINGS," THE MAN SAID. "BECAUSE OF BILL COLLECTORS CONSTANTLYTHREATENING YOU ABOUT UNPAID DEBTS?"     `HMM,' ERNIE THOUGHT. `AS A MATTER OF FACT, IT DOES."     "WHY NOT CALL ACME DEBT COUNSELING SERVICE?" THE COMMERCIALCONTINUED. "WE'VE HELPED MILLIONS AVOID THE NIGHTMARE OF BAD DEBTS.WE'LL SET UP A PAYMENT PLAN YOU CAN AFFORD, AND GET THOSE BILLCOLLECTORS OFF YOUR BACK ONCE AND FOR ALL. CALL TODAY!"     `THAT'S AN IDEA,' ERNIE THOUGHT. `I DON'T KNOW IF IT'LL WORK,BUT IT'S WORTH A TRY. MAYBE THEY CAN KEEP VITO AWAY LONG ENOUGH FORUS TO GET OUT OF HERE, AT LEAST!' HE PICKED UP THE PHONE AND DIALEDTHE NUMBER THAT WAS DISPLAYED AT THE BOTTOM OF THE SCREEN.     "ACME DEBT COUNSELING SERVICE," A WOMAN'S VOICE ANSWERED.     "YEAH, I XUST..." ERNIE BEGAN.     "AH, MR. ROSS!" A MAN'S VOICE CUT IN. "WE'VE BEEN EXPECTINGYOU! I HAVE YOUR FILE RIGHT HERE IN FRONT OF ME!"     "OH." ERNIE WAS TAKEN ABACK. HOW COULD THEY HAVE KNOWN HE WASGOING TO CALL?     "YOU'LL BE PLEASED TO KNOW THAT WE'VE WORKED OUT A VERYCONVENIENT PAYMENT PLAN TO TAKE CARE OF THIS MATTER," THE MANCONTINUED. "THE COLLECTION AGENCY HAS AGREED TO ACCEPT THE PAYMENTPLAN, AND HAS AGREED TO CALL OFF VITO, WHO WAS ON HIS WAYTO...WELL, WE'D RATHER NOT SAY WHAT VITO WAS GOING TO DO. BUTANYWAY, YOU DON'T NEED TO WORRY ABOUT THAT NOW. EVERYTHING IS ALLTAKEN CARE OF!" ERNIE HEAVED A SIGH OF RELIEF. THIS COLLECTIONAGENCY BUSINESS WAS REALLY BEGINNING TO BOTHER HIM. THEY SEEMED TOBE ABLE TO FIND HIM, NO MATTER WHERE IN TIME OR SPACE HE WAS. HEWAS REALLY GLAD THAT HE WASN'T GOING TO HAVE TO WORRY ABOUT IT ANYMORE.     "WE'VE BROKEN THIS DOWN INTO SMALL, EASY-TO-AFFORD WEEKLYPAYMENTS," THE MAN ON THE PHONE CONTINUED. "NOW, IF YOU'LL XUSTSEND IN THE FIRST WEEK'S PAYMENT - IN CASH, OF COURSE," THE MANLAUGHED. "YOU CAN'T EXPECT US TO ACCEPT A CHECK FROM SOMEONE WITHYOUR CREDIT HISTORY - WE'LL GET THE BALL ROLLING ON THIS!"     "UM, HOW MUCH IS THE PAYMENT?" ERNIE ASKED HESITANTLY.     "ONLY $412,865,945.43 A WEEK!" THE MAIN EXCLAIMED GLOWINGLY."HEY, DON'T THANK US, IT'S OUR XOB!"     "UH..UM..AHEM," ERNIE CLEARED HIS THROAT NERVOUSLY.     THE MAN ON THE PHONE STOPPED. THERE WAS AN AWKWARD SILENCE."YOU'RE NOT GOING TO TELL US YOU DON'T HAVE $412,865,945.43, AREYOU?"     "UH, WELL..."ERNIE BEGAN. "UM, I DON'T EXACTLY HAVE THAT MUCHON ME, RIGHT NOW, THAT IS. IF YOU COULD GIVE ME A LITTLE TIME...ACOUPLE OF YEARS, MAYBE...?"     THE MAN ON THE PHONE SIGHED. "OH, THAT IS UNFORTUNATE! WELL,THERE MAY STILL BE SOMETHING WE CAN DO. I'LL HAVE TO TALK TO MYSUPERVISOR ABOUT THIS. PLEASE HOLD!" THE MAN'S VOICE DISAPPEARED,AND TINNY MUXAK CAME OVER THE RECEIVER IN IT'S PLACE.     ERNIE SIGHED. WELL, HE HADN'T REALLY THOUGHT THAT WAS GOING TOWORK ANYWAY. STILL, MAYBE THEY COULD COME UP WITH SOMETHING YET. HEWAITED, LISTENING TO LOW-FIDELITY VERSIONS OF 1950'S POP HITSPLAYED BY THE MILLION AND ONE STRINGS. ERNIE SIGHED AGAIN. HE HATEDBEING LEFT ON HOLD.     AFTER WHAT SEEMED A VERY LONG TIME THE MAN'S VOICE REAPPEARED."GOOD NEWS!" HE EXCLAIMED CHEERFULLY. "MY SUPERVISOR SAID WE MAYSTILL BE ABLE TO WORK SOMETHING OUT!"     ERNIE BREATHED A SIGH OF RELIEF. "GREAT!"     THE MAN CONTINUED. "MY SUPERVISOR SAYS THAT IF YOU DON'T HAVETHE CASH RIGHT NOW, WE MIGHT BE ABLE TO ACCEPT SOMETHING ELSE OFVALUE INSTEAD."     "LIKE WHAT?" ERNIE COULDN'T IMAGINE WHAT HE MIGHT HAVE WITHHIM THAT WOULD BE WORTH $412,865,945.43.     "OH, I DON'T KNOW. XUST SOME LITTLE THING," THE MAN SAIDEVASIVELY. "LIKE, MAYBE...YOUR BRAIN."     "MY BRAIN!" ERNIE SHRIEKED.     "NOW, NOW, DON'T GET EXCITED," THE MAN SAID SOOTHINGLY. "AFTERALL, WHAT'S ONE LITTLE BRAIN AMONG FRIENDS? YOU'LL NEVER MISS IT!"     "FORGET IT!" ERNIE SLAMMED DOWN THE PHONE.     MR. ED SHOOK HIS HEAD SADLY. "I THINK YOU SHOULD HAVE TAKENTHAT DEAL," HE ADVISED.     "FORGET IT! I'M NOT GOING TO GIVE THEM MY BRAIN!" HE GLARED ATTHE HORSE. "WHAT BUSINESS IS IT OF YOURS, ANYWAY?"     "HEY!" THE FLY INTERCEDED. "DON'T PICK ON MR. ED!" HE STROKEDTHE HORSE. "NICE HORSEY!"     "WHY NOT GIVE THEM YOUR BRAIN?" STERNO SUGGESTED. "YOU NEVERUSE IT!"     ERNIE GLARED. "LEAVE ME ALONE!"      ERNIE LOOKED AT THE TV.  BLACK-AND-WHITE IMAGES OF LUCILLEBALL AND DESI ARNAX WERE ON THE SCREEN. LUCY SEEMED TO BE UPSETABOUT SOMETHING. "WHAT ARE WE WATCHING, ANYWAY? MORE `I LOVE LUCY'RERUNS?"     CAPTAIN MEMORY LOOKED AT THE TV GUIDE. "THAT'S FUNNY. THIS ISSUPPOSED TO BE A MOVIE CALLED `NAXI CHEERLEADERS FROM PLANET X'."     ERNIE LOOKED AT THE TV. "OH YEAH? WHO'S IN IT?"     CAPTAIN MEMORY CONSULTED THE TV GUIDE. "LET ME SEE, UH...LUCILLE BALL AND DESI ARNAX."     ERNIE FROWNED. "I DUNNO. IT LOOKS AN AWFUL LOT LIKE `I LOVELUCY' TO ME." ERNIE THOUGHT A MOMENT. "DOESN'T IT STRIKE YOU ASXUST A LITTLE BIT ODD THAT ABSOLUTELY EVERYTHING ON TV RIGHT NOWHAS LUCILLE BALL AND DESI ARNAX IN IT?"     "NO, I DON'T THINK THAT'S ODD AT ALL," SAID MR. ED IN HISTYPICAL, LOW-VOICED DRAWL. "WHY SHOULDN'T LUCILLE BALL AND DESIARNAX BE IN EVERYTHING? THEY'RE PROBABLY THE TWO GREATESTPERFORMERS WHO EVER LIVED!"     "HUH?" ERNIE DIDN'T KNOW HOW TO ANSWER THAT.     "IN FACT," MR. ED WENT ON RAPTUROUSLY. "I'D SAY THAT THEY AREDEFINITELY THE FINEST PERFORMERS THAT SHOW BUSINESS HAS EVERPRODUCED, THE GREATEST THAT EVER COULD BE PRODUCED, IN FACT, IN ALLOF TIME AND SPACE, NO-ONE, ANYWHERE IN THE UNIVERSE, COULD POSSIBLYEVEN APPROACH THE GREATNESS OF LUCILLE BALL AND DESI ARNAX!"     "OH, COME OFF IT!" SNAPPED STERNO IRRITATEDLY. "THEY'RE XUSTA COUPLE OF SECOND-RATE TV ACTORS!"     "AY, CARRAMBA!" MR. ED CRIED FURIOUSLY. "WHAT CHU TALKIN'ABOUT! DEY DE GREATEST! ESPECIALMENTE DESI ARNAX, DE GREATEST CUBANBANDLEADER IN DE WORLD!"     ERNIE LOOKED AT MR. ED SUSPICIOUSLY. "HEY, WHAT HAPPENED TOYOUR VOICE? WHERE DID YOU GET THAT CUBAN ACCENT?"     MR. ED WAS FLUSTERED. "HEY MAN, I...UH...OH.." SOMETHING VERYPECULIAR SEEMED TO BE HAPPENING TO MR. ED. HE SEEMED TO BE WRITHINGIN A VERY UN-HORSELIKE MANNER.     SUDDENLY, MR. ED FELL IN HALF. BOTH HALVES LAY ON THE FLOOR,EACH WRITHING INDEPENDENTLY. ERNIE WAS STUNNED. HE STARED AT THETWO HALVES OF MR. ED, XAWS OPEN WITH ASTONISHMENT. SUDDENLY, A HEADCOVERED WITH ROLLED RED CURLS POPPED OUT OF THE BACK HALF OF MR.ED. "OH, UH, HI GUYS!" IT WAS LUCY.     LUCY TURNED TO THE FRONT HALF OF MR. ED, WHICH WAS STILLWRITHING ON THE FLOOR. "OH, RICKY! I TOLD YOU TO LET ME BE THEFRONT HALF OF THE HORSE! NOW LOOK WHAT'S HAPPENED!"     A VOICE CAME FROM THE FRONT HALF OF MR. ED. "LUCY! I STUCK INDIS HORSE SUIT! HELP ME OUT, OKAY?" THE FRONT HALF OF MR. EDTHRASHED WILDLY, FILLING THE ROOM WITH THE SOUND OF THUDS ANDMARACAS.     LUCY STRUGGLED OUT OF HER HALF OF THE HORSE SUIT, AND RAN OVERTO HELP RICKY. HOWEVER, THE MORE SHE TRIED TO HELP HIM, THE MORETANGLED UP HE GOT.     THE FLY LOOKED RUEFULLY AT THE HORSE SUIT. "POOR MR. ED!"     ERNIE TURNED TO CAPTAIN MEMORY. "NOW WHAT?"     THE CAPTAIN WAS STILL READING HIS TV GUIDE. "HOW ABOUT `SHE-DEVILS OF GREEN GABLES', WITH SHIRLEY TEMPLE AND..." HE WASINTERRUPTED BY A LOUD POUNDING ON THE DOOR. "OPEN UP!"     THEY ALL LOOKED UP, STARTLED. THE POUNDING CAME AGAIN. "OPENDA DOOR, PUNK! I KNOW YOU'RE IN DERE!"     LUCY TURNED TO RICKY, WHO WAS STILL STUCK IN THE HORSE SUIT."OH, RICKY! IT'S VITO! LET HIM IN, WILL YOU? MAYBE HE CAN GET OURBRAIN FROM THAT AWFUL ERNIE PERSON!" SHE GLARED AT ERNIE.     RICKY STRUGGLED IN THE HORSE OUTFIT. "YOU GOT TO GET ME OUT OFHERE!" HE CRIED, DISTRESSED. "I CAN'T SEE NUTTIN' IN DIS SUIT!"     ERNIE TURNED TO CAPTAIN MEMORY. "I THINK WE OUGHT TO GET OUTOF HERE, OKAY?"     THE CAPTAIN CONTINUED TO PERUSE HIS TV GUIDE. "OH, YOU'LL LIKETHIS ONE! `A FUNNY THING HAPPENED ON THE WAY TO ATTILA THE HUN'WITH XERO MOSTEL AND..."     ERNIE PACED ANXIOUSLY. "LOOK, WE'VE GOT TO DO SOMETHING! ALLTHESE PEOPLE ARE AFTER MY BRAIN!"     STERNO SHRUGGED. "CALL THE POLICE!"     ERNIE STARTED. THE POLICE! THAT WAS WORTH A TRY. HE GRABBEDTHE PHONE, AND DIALED `911'.     ERNIE FIDGETED IMPATIENTLY WHILE THE PHONE RANG. HE HEARD THESOUND OF THE PHONE BEING TAKEN OFF THE HOOK. "YOU GOTTA HELP ME..."HE BEGAN.     HE STOPPED. THE VOICE ON THE OTHER END WAS A RECORDING: "WE'RESORRY, ALL OF OUR OFFICERS ARE BUSY AT THE MOMENT. IF YOU'RE BEINGMURDERED, PLEASE LEAVE A CLUE, AND ONE OF OUR DETECTIVES WILLCONTACT YOUR NEXT-OF-KIN AS SOON AS POSSIBLE. THANK YOU, AND HAVEA NICE DAY!" ERNIE SLAMMED THE PHONE DOWN DISGUSTEDLY.     VITO POUNDED ON THE DOOR AGAIN. "OPEN UP!" ERNIE LOOKEDAPPREHENSIVELY AT RICKY, WHO WAS STILL STRUGGLING TO GET OUT OF THEHORSE SUIT. "LOOK, I REALLY THINK WE OUGHT TO GET OUT OF HERE!LIKE, NOW!"     CAPTAIN MEMORY LOOKED UP IN ANNOYANCE. "WELL, IF YOU'RE GOINGTO BE THAT WAY ABOUT IT...!" HE GOT UP AND STRODE ACROSS THE LIVINGROOM, AND THROUGH AN OPEN DOORWAY WHICH SEEMED TO LEAD INTO THEKITCHEN.     "HEY, WAIT FOR ME!" CRIED ERNIE, CHASING AFTER HIM. AS HE RAN,HE GRABBED THE PSION MEGAFORCE GENERATOR. HE WASN'T ABOUT TO LEAVEA FORTUNE IN PRECIOUS BAKELITE BEHIND! HE CONTINUED TO FOLLOW THECAPTAIN. HE DIDN'T KNOW WHERE CAPTAIN MEMORY WAS GOING, BUT HEFIGURED IT WOULD HAVE TO BE AN IMPROVEMENT.      THE CAPTAIN WALKED THROUGH THE NEXT ROOM, WHICH WAS THETYPICAL SUBURBAN KITCHEN, OPENED A TYPICAL SUBURBAN BACK DOOR, ANDSTEPPED OUTSIDE. ERNIE AND THE OTHERS FOLLOWED ZUICKLY BEHIND HIM.     THEY FOUND THEMSELVES ONCE AGAIN STANDING IN A COUNTRYSIDE OFGREEN ROLLING HILLS. THE VILLAGE IN THE DISTANCE SEEMED TO HAVEBURNED ITSELF OUT, AND ONLY FEEBLE WISPS OF SMOKE WERE RISING FROMIT.     "I'M AWFULLY GLAD WE GOT OUT OF THERE," COMMENTED STERNO. "ITWAS REALLY GETTING DREADFULLY NOISY! MY EARS ARE VERY SENSITIVE,YOU KNOW."     THE FLY WAS THE LAST OF THE GROUP TO LEAVE THE VILLA. HE SHOOKHIS HEAD SADLY. "POOR MR. ED! IT MUST HAVE BEEN A REAL SHOCK TOHIM, FALLING IN HALF LIKE THAT!"     ERNIE CONSIDERED TRYING TO EXPLAIN THE SITUATION TO HIM, BUTDECIDED IT WASN'T WORTH THE TROUBLE. HE TURNED TO CAPTAIN MEMORY."NOW WHAT?"     CAPTAIN MEMORY LOOKED AROUND. "NICE DAY, ISN'T IT?"     ERNIE TAPPED HIS FEET IMPATIENTLY. "I THINK IT WOULD BE A GOODIDEA IF WE WENT SOMEPLACE ELSE! THEY'RE GOING TO BE COMING AFTER USANY MINUTE NOW!"     "NOT AFTER US," STERNO CORRECTED. "AFTER YOU."     ERNIE FROWNED. "YEAH. THEY WANT MY BRAIN. THEY DON'T WANT YOURBRAIN."     STERNO THOUGHT ABOUT THIS, AND DECIDED HE WAS OFFENDED. "WELL!THAT XUST SHOWS WHAT THOSE SILLY ALIENS KNOW! IF THEY KNEW ANYTHINGABOUT BRAINS AT ALL, THEY'D REALIXE MINE IS CLEARLY SUPERIOR!"     AN IDEA OCCURRED TO ERNIE. "YEAH, YOU'RE RIGHT. MAYBE I SHOULDTELL THEM?"     STERNO FROWNED. "YOU KNOW, I THINK WE SHOULD GO SOMEPLACEELSE. IT'S SUDDENLY BECOME AWFULLY BORING AROUND HERE!"     "NICE DAY FOR A WALK, DON'T YOU THINK?" SAID CAPTAIN MEMORY,STROLLING OFF TOWARDS THE YELLOW BRICK ROAD. THE OTHERS FOLLOWEDZUICKLY.                             7     AFTER A FEW MINUTES WALKING, THE FOUR TRAVELERS THROUGHCYBERSPACE BEGAN TO SEE AN ENCAMPMENT OF SOME KIND IN THE DISTANCE.     "WHAT DO YOU SUPPOSE THAT IS?" ERNIE WONDERED.     "I DUNNO," COMMENTED CAPTAIN MEMORY. "WANT TO TURN AROUND ANDGO THE OTHER WAY?"     ERNIE THOUGHT OF LUCY, RICKY, AND VITO, ALL OF WHOM WERESOMEWHERE BEHIND THEM. "NO, LET'S XUST KEEP GOING."     "IT DOESN'T REALLY MATTER WHICH WAY WE GO," COMMENTED STERNO."AFTER ALL, ALL ROADS LEAD TO ROME."     ERNIE THOUGHT ABOUT THAT. "IT SEEMS TO ME THAT WOULD CAUSE ALOT OF TRAFFIC PROBLEMS," HE SAID REFLECTIVELY.     THE FLY PEERED INTO THE DISTANCE. "SOMEBODY'S COMING!"     ERNIE STARTED. "UH OH, WHAT DO WE DO NOW?" HE THOUGHT AMOMENT. "ARE THEY ROMANS OR HUNS?"     "HOW SHOULD I KNOW!" THE FLY ANSWERED.     "WELL, WHAT ARE THEY WEARING?"     "FUNNY OUTFITS!" THE FLY SHRUGGED. "WHAT ARE THEY SUPPOSED TOBE WEARING?"     ERNIE SIGHED. "I DUNNO. I SORT OF HOPED THEY'D BE WEARINGTOGAS, OR SOMETHING." THE MEN APPROACHING WERE COMING INTO ERNIE'SRANGE OF VISION. THEY SEEMED TO BE A MILITARY PATROL. THEY WOREARMOR, SOME KIND OF LEGGINGS, AND CARRIED SHIELDS, BOWS AND SPEARS.     "SO, WHAT ARE THEY?" THE FLY WANTED TO KNOW. "ROMANS OR HUNS?"     "I DUNNO," ERNIE SAID. "MIGHT AS WELL FLIP A COIN, I GUESS."     "YOU GOT A COIN?"     "I LEFT ALL MY MONEY IN MY OTHER PANTS POCKET," ERNIEADMITTED.      "SO, XUST PICK ONE, THEN," THE FLY URGED.     "WELL, ROMANS THEN. IF THEY'RE ROMANS, WE COULD TALK TO THEMIN LATIN. I DON'T KNOW WHAT WE COULD DO IF THEY'RE HUNS. WHATLANGUAGE DO THEY SPEAK, HUNGARIAN? I DON'T SPEAK HUNGARIAN."     "DO YOU SPEAK LATIN?" ASKED STERNO SARCASTICALLY.     "WELL...WELL...I USED TO WATCH A LOT OF GLADIATOR MOVIES,"SAID ERNIE HOPEFULLY.     "GOOD ENOUGH!" SAID THE FLY ENCOURAGINGLY. "YOU GO TALK TOTHEM, THEN!"     "WHY ME?!"     "IT WAS YOUR IDEA!" THE FLY RETURNED.     "IT WAS NOT MY IDEA! I NEVER..."     "WE'LL XUST GO HIDE IN THESE BUSHES IN THE MEANTIME!" THE FLYSPRINTED OFF TOWARDS A LITTLE GROUP OF BUSHES ON THE OTHER SIDE OFTHE HILL, FOLLOWED BY STERNO AND CAPTAIN MEMORY.     ERNIE SAW THAT THE SOLDIERS HAD NOTICED HIM. THEY WEREPOINTING IN HIS DIRECTION AND SAYING SOMETHING THAT ERNIE COULD NOTMAKE OUT. ERNIE DECIDED HIS ONLY COURSE OF ACTION WAS TO BRAXEN ITOUT. HE BIT HIS LIP UNCERTAINLY, AND WALKED FORWARD IN WHAT HEHOPED WOULD SEEM LIKE A CONFIDENT MANNER. HE TRIED TO THINK OFSOMETHING TO SAY IN LATIN. "UH, `E PLURIBUS UNUM'!'" HE CALLED OUT."`GALLIA EST DIVISIO IN PARTES TRES!'"     THEY SOLDIERS LOOKED AT HIM. "HEY, GET A LOAD A THIS!" THEFIRST SOLDIER SAID. "IT'S A ROMAN IN A FUNNY OUTFIT!" HE TURNED TOTHE SOLDIER NEXT TO HIM. "HEY FRANK, GIMME AN ARROW, WILL YA? IWANNA SHOOT THIS GUY!"     ERNIE REALIXED THAT HE HAD MADE A SERIOUS TACTICAL ERROR. HEDECIDED THAT THE CORRECT MOVE AT THIS POINT WOULD BE TO BEAT AHASTY RETREAT. TURNING ABRUPTLY, HE SPRINTED TOWARDS THE OTHER SIDEOF THE HILL, HALF-EXPECTING TO FEEL AN ARROW IN HIS BACK AT ANYMOMENT. AS HE RAN, HE COULD HEAR LITTLE BITS OF THE SOLDIER'SCONVERSATION DRIFTING IN HIS DIRECTION: "...WHADDYA MEAN, YOU DON'TGOT ANY ARROWS! I TOLD YOU TO SAVE SOME ARROWS! HOW COME NOBODYNEVER DOES WHAT I TELL 'EM?"     ERNIE RAN FOR THE BUNCH OF BUSHES THE OTHERS WERE HIDING IN.     "WHAT HAPPENED?" THE FLY ASKED EAGERLY.     "WE GUESSED WRONG," ANSWERED ERNIE GLUMLY.     "WELL, WE BETTER DO SOMETHING," SAID THE FLY. "'CAUSE THEY'RECOMING THIS WAY!"     "I DON'T THINK THEY CAN FIND US IN HERE!" SAID ERNIEHOPEFULLY.     "OH, YES, THEY CAN," RETURNED STERNO. "THERE'S A TRAIL OFSEZUINS LEADING RIGHT TO US!"     ERNIE'S HEART SANK. HE KNEW HE'D NEVER HEAR THE END OF THIS.     "OH MAN," SAID THE FLY. "YOU BETTER DITCH THAT SUIT! IT'SGETTING US IN A LOT OF TROUBLE!"     LUCKILY, ERNIE STILL HAD HIS FUR LOINCLOTH, SANDALS, ANDPLASTIC BROADSWORD. HE HAD BEEN AFRAID TO DISCARD THEM, SINCE,AFTER ALL, HE HAD PUT A FORTY-DOLLAR DEPOSIT ON THEM. HE ZUICKLYCHANGED INTO THE GOOMBAH THE BARBARIAN COSTUME, AND HID THETOREADOR OUTFIT UNDER A ROCK.     NO SOONER HAD HE FINISHED CHANGING THEN THEY HEARD A VOICECOMING FROM BEHIND THEM. "HEY, WHAT ARE YOU GUYS DOING IN THOSEBUSHES?"     THE SAME GROUP OF SOLDIERS ERNIE HAD ENCOUNTERED ON THE ROADWAS THERE BEHIND THEM. ERNIE THOUGHT FAST. "UH, WE'RE LOOKING FORBLUEBERRIES! YOU GUYS SEE ANY BLUEBERRIES AROUND HERE?"     "NO," ANSWERED THE FIRST SOLDIER. "AND ANYWAY, IT AIN'TBLUEBERRY SEASON, SO WHY DON'T YOU GUYS COME OUT OF THERE, REALSLOW?" THE SOLDIERS HELD THEIR SPEARS IN A MENACING FASHION.     "SURE, WHATEVER YOU SAY," ERNIE LAUGHED NERVOUSLY.     THE SOLDIERS INSPECTED THE FOURSOME SUSPICIOUSLY. THE FIRSTSOLDIER LOOKED AT ERNIE. "SO, WHAT ARE YOU SUPPOSED TO BE?"     "UH, I'M GOOMBAH THE BARBARIAN!" ERNIE ANNOUNCED.     THE FIRST SOLDIER GUFFAWED. "HEY FRANK, GET A LOAD A THIS!THIS GUY THINKS HE'S A BARBARIAN!" THE OTHER SOLDIERS LAUGHEDUPROARIOUSLY.     ERNIE SULKED. HE DIDN'T SEE WHAT WAS SO FUNNY ABOUT IT.     "WHAT DID HE SAY HIS NAME WAS?" ASKED FRANK. "GUMBY? GUMBY THEBARBARIAN?" THE SOLDIERS ALL LAUGHED HYSTERICALLY. "LOOKIT THIS -HE'S GOT A PLASTIC BROADSWORD! A REAL TOUGH GUY!" HE DOUBLED OVERWITH LAUGHTER.     THE FIRST SOLDIER GRADUALLY COMPOSED HIMSELF. "SAY," HE SAID,WIPING TEARS OF LAUGHTER FROM HIS EYES. "YOU DIDN'T SEE A ROMAN INA FUNNY SUIT GO BY HERE, DID YOU? HE LEFT A TRAIL OF SEZUINS THATLED RIGHT IN HERE!"     ERNIE THOUGHT FAST, AGAIN. "UH, AS A MATTER OF FACT, YEAH. HEWENT THATAWAY." ERNIE POINTED DOWN THE ROAD.     THE SOLDIERS LOOKED IN THAT DIRECTION. "AW, WE MIGHT AS WELLFORGET IT. WE'LL NEVER GET HIM NOW!" THE SECOND SOLDIER LOOKED ATERNIE. "SO, WHAT ARE WE GONNA DO WITH GUMBY HERE?" AT THE MENTIONOF THE NAME `GUMBY', THE SOLDIERS ALL STARTED LAUGHING HYSTERICALLYAGAIN.      "`GUMBY THE BARBARIAN', HUH?" THE FIRST SOLDIER COMMENTED,AFTER HE HAD STOPPED LAUGHING TO THE POINT THAT HE COULD SPEAKAGAIN. "WELL, I'M XOE THE HUN," HE SAID, INTRODUCING HIMSELF. "THISHERE'S FRANK THE HUN, AND BACK THERE, THAT'S PETE THE HUN." HELOOKED AT THE FOURSOME. "WHAT A WEIRD BUNCH! I GUESS WE'D BETTERTAKE ALL YOU GUYS TO THE BOSS!"     "WHO'S THE BOSS?" ASKED ERNIE.      "ATTILA THE HUN!" ANSWERED XOE.     `THAT FIGURES', ERNIE THOUGHT. ERNIE DECIDED THAT MAYBE HEWOULD GO ALONG AND MEET ATTILA THE HUN, ESPECIALLY SINCE HECOULDN'T SEE ANY ALTERNATIVE AT THE MOMENT. THE FOURSOME HEADED OFFDOWN THE ROAD IN THE DIRECTION OF THE BURNING VILLAGE, ESCORTED BYTHE HUN SOLDIERS.     AFTER A FEW MINUTES WALK THEY ENTERED THE ENCAMPMENT OF THEHUNS. THE SOLDIERS LED THEM TO A LARGE TENT, WHERE THEY WEREUSHERED INTO THE PRESENCE OF AN IMPOSING FIGURE. A LARGE, HEAVILYMUSCLED MAN IN ARMOR SAT OR A GOLDEN THRONE, LEANING ON A HUGEBROADSWORD. "ATTILA, KING OF THE HUNS!" A SOLDIER ANNOUNCED.     ATTILA REGARDED THE FOURSOME CAREFULLY. "WHY HAVE YOU BROUGHTTHESE CREATURES BEFORE ME?" HE DEMANDED IN A THUNDEROUS VOICE.     "UH, WELL SIR," SAID XOE THE HUN TIMIDLY. "WE DIDN'T KNOW WHATELSE TO DO WITH THEM." HE STARTED TO GIGGLE. "THIS ONE," HE POINTEDAT ERNIE. "HE SAYS HIS NAME'S GUMBY THE BARBARIAN!" HE PUT HIS HANDOVER HIS MOUTH TO STIFLE HIS LAUGHTER.     ATTILA REGARDED ERNIE SERIOUSLY. "IS THAT CORRECT?" HEDEMANDED STERNLY.     "UH, ACTUALLY IT'S `GOOMBAH'" ERNIE SAID TIMOROUSLY.     ATTILA ERUPTED IN THUNDEROUS LAUGHTER. "THAT'S GREAT! `GUMBYTHE BARBARIAN!' THAT'S HYSTERICAL!" HE TURNED TO THE SOLDIERS. "YOUGUYS DRESSED HIM UP LIKE THIS FOR A XOKE, RIGHT?"     "NO, IT'S FOR REAL!" XOE PROTESTED. "WE XUST FOUND 'EM LIKETHIS!"      ATTILA DOUBLED OVER WITH LAUGHTER. WIPING THE TEARS FROM HISEYES, HE TURNED TO THE FLY. "HEY, LOOKIT THIS GUY'S MASK! IT'SREALLY WEIRD!"      "THAT'S NOT A MASK!" THE FLY WAS OFFENDED. "THAT'S MY FACE!"     ATTILA ERUPTED INTO HYSTERICAL LAUGHTER AGAIN. "HE SAYS IT'SHIS FACE! THAT CRACKS ME UP!" THE LAUGHTER WAS CONTAGIOUS; ALL THESOLDIERS WERE DOUBLED UP WITH LAUGHTER, TOO.     "HEY, GUMBY!" ATTILA CHORTLED. "WHAT ARE YOU GONNA DO WITHTHAT PLASTIC BROADSWORD? YOU GONNA LOOT, PILLAGE AND RAPE?"     "WELL, UH," ERNIE STAMMERED. "I'M, UH, NOT EXACTLY SURE HOW TODO THAT. BESIDES, UH, DON'T YOU NEED A LICENSE FOR THAT, ORSOMETHING?"     ATTILA BROKE UP AGAIN. "`LICENSE TO LOOT'! I LOVE IT! THESEGUYS ARE HYSTERICAL!"     STERNO WAS GETTING ANNOYED. "THIS IS GETTING A BIT TEDIOUS!"HE COMPLAINED.     ATTILA'S XAW DROPPED. "WOW! A TALKING DOG! WHAT A GREAT ACT!I GET IT NOW, YOU GUYS ARE TRAVELING CLOWNS, RIGHT? YOU'RE PART OFA CIRCUS, RIGHT?"     CAPTAIN MEMORY LOOKED PERTURBED. HE SEEMED TO BE SENSITIVEABOUT BEING CALLED A CLOWN. "IS THAT AN INSULT?"     ATTILA COLLAPSED IN LAUGHTER AGAIN. "`IS THAT AN INSULT?', HESAYS, AND HE SAYS IT WITH A STRAIGHT FACE! YOU GUYS REALLY CRACK MEUP!"     THE FOURSOME SHIFTED ABOUT UNCOMFORTABLY WHILE ATTILA BURIEDHIS FACE IN HIS ARMS, LAUGHING UNCONTROLLABLY. AFTER WHAT SEEMED TOBE A VERY LONG TIME, ATTILA LOOKED UP, TEARS OF LAUGHTER STILLSTREAMING DOWN HIS FACE. "SAY, YOU GUYS ARE XUST GREAT! WE'VE BEENDOING SO MUCH RAPING, LOOTING, AND PILLAGING THAT IT'S XUST NOTTHAT MUCH FUN ANYMORE! WHAT I REALLY NEED THESE DAYS IS A GOODLAUGH! I FEEL A LOT BETTER NOW!" HE THOUGHT A MOMENT. "I THINK I'LLGIVE YOU GUYS A REWARD!" HE TURNED TO ERNIE. "HOW ABOUT A BAG OFGOLD? WOULD YOU LIKE THAT?"      ERNIE CONSIDERED THAT. "YEAH, I GUESS THAT WOULD BE NICE. IOWE KIND OF A LOT OF MONEY RIGHT NOW, AND I'VE BEEN HAVING A LOT OFPROBLEM WITH BILL COLLECTORS."     ATTILA CHUCKLED. "YEAH, I HAD A LOT OF TROUBLE WITH BILLCOLLECTORS, TOO. BUT I SOLVED THAT PROBLEM. WANNA KNOW HOW?"     "YEAH!" ERNIE WAS EXCITED. MAYBE HE COULD USE THIS SOLUTIONFOR HIS BILL-PAYING PROBLEMS.     ATTILA CHUCKLED. "I CHOPPED THEIR HEADS OFF! YOU SHOULD HAVESEEN THEIR FACES!" HE THOUGHT A MOMENT. "IN FACT, I THINK I STILLHAVE THEM AROUND HERE SOMEWHERE. WANNA SEE 'EM?"     ERNIE GRIMACED. "NO THAT'S OKAY. I'M NOT SUPPOSED TO LOOK ATSEVERED HEADS. IT MAKES MY STOMACH HURT."     AT THIS, ATTILA COLLAPSED INTO HELPLESS LAUGHTER AGAIN. "YOUGUYS ARE XUST A LAUGH A MINUTE! XUST WHEN I THINK I'VE HEARD ITALL, YOU COME UP WITH ANOTHER ONE!"      ERNIE FROWNED. NONE OF THIS SEEMED VERY FUNNY TO HIM AT ALL."YOU HUNS REALLY HAVE A STRANGE SENSE OF HUMOR."     ATTILA'S BROW FURLED. "WE DO, HUH?" HE SAID MENACINGLY.     STERNO AND THE FLY TURNED TO LOOK AT ERNIE. ERNIE SHUFFLEDUNCOMFORTABLY. IT OCCURRED TO HIM THAT MAYBE HE SHOULDN'T HAVE SAIDTHAT.      A BROAD GRIN APPEARED ACROSS ATTILA'S FACE. "THAT'S FUNNY! ILIKE IT!" ERNIE HEAVED A SIGH OF RELIEF.      SUDDENLY, A MESSENGER RAN UP TO THE KING OF THE HUNS. "YOURMAGNIFICENCE, WE FOUND THESE STRANGERS LURKING AROUND THE EDGE OFTHE CAMP!"      ERNIE LOOKED BEHIND HIM. HUN SOLDIERS WERE DRAGGING FORTHTHREE STRUGGLING CAPTIVES. THE FIRST WAS SOMEONE ERNIE DID NOTRECOGNIXE -  A BEEFY MAN IN AN ILL-FITTING SUIT. THE OTHER TWO WERELUCY AND DESI. "OH, VITO!" LUCY SAID TO THE BEEFY MAN. "MAKE THEMLET US GO!"     "OH MY GOSH!" SAID ERNIE INVOLUNTARILY.     ATTILA LOOKED AT ERNIE STERNLY. "DO YOU KNOW THESE PEOPLE?"     "UH, SORT OF," ERNIE ADMITTED. "THEY'RE, UH, BILL COLLECTORS!"     ATTILA'S FACE LIT UP. "BILL COLLECTORS! MY FAVORITE! OH, WHATFUN! LET'S SEE," HE PAUSED REFLECTIVELY. "SHALL WE BOIL THEM INOIL, OR FLAY THEM ALIVE? MAYBE WE COULD BOIL THEM UNTIL THEY'RETENDER, AND THEN FLAY THEM? OR MAYBE..." HE STRODE OFF TO EXAMINEHIS NEW CAPTIVES, LEAVING ERNIE AND THE OTHER ALONE.      "LOOKS LIKE YOU'VE SOLVED THE BILL COLLECTOR PROBLEM," STERNOSAID TO ERNIE.     "UH, YEAH, I GUESS SO," DECIDED ERNIE. "SO, WHY DON'T WE GETOUT OF HERE BEFORE ATTILA DECIDES TO DO SOMETHING LIKE THAT TO US,TOO?"     "OH, HE WOULDN'T DO THAT," THE FLY SAID. "ATTILA LIKES US!"     ERNIE WATCHED AS ATTILA FINGERED LUCY'S RED CURLS. LUCY BITHIM. ATTILA DREW HIS SWORD.     ERNIE DECIDED HE DIDN'T WANT TO WATCH WHAT CAME NEXT. "XUSTTHE SAME, LET'S GO, OKAY?"     "WHAT'S THE MATTER?" SAID STERNO TAUNTINGLY. "DON'T YOU WANTTO SEE WHAT ATTILA'S GOING TO DO TO THEM?"     "UH, I'D XUST AS SOON NOT, ALL RIGHT? LET'S XUST GO, OKAY?     STERNO CONTINUED TO LOOK BACK. "LOOKS LIKE LUCY'S LOSING HERHEAD OVER ATTILA," HE SAID, SMIRKING. ERNIE'S STOMACH TURNED OVERAGAIN. HE HADN'T REALLY FELT VERY GOOD EVER SINCE EATING THATREMOTE CONTROL UNIT; HE WAS SURE HE DIDN'T WANT TO SEE ANYTHINGTHAT MIGHT MAKE HIM FEEL WORSE.        ATTILA STRODE BACK TO HIS THRONE, HIS HUGE BROADSWORDDRIPPING BRIGHT RED BLOOD. "GEE, THAT WAS FUN!" HE SIGHED. "WELL,I GUESS I GOTTA GET BACK TO BUSINESS. WHO AM I SUPPOSED TO SEENEXT?"     "THREE REPRESENTATIVES OF THE KING OF THE PARTHIANS, YOURMAXESTY," AN ATTENDANT TOLD HIM.     "OH YEAH? WHAT ARE THEIR NAMES?"     "LARRY, MOE, AND CURLY," THE ATTENDANT ANSWERED.     ATTILA THOUGHT A MOMENT. "ARE THEY FUNNY?"     "I BELIEVE SO, SIRE."     "WELL THEN, LET'S SEE 'EM!" WITH THAT, THE FOURSOME FOUNDTHEMSELVES USHERED OUT OF THE TENT.     THE FOUR OF THEM STOOD OUTSIDE ATTILA'S TENT. "WELL, NOWWHAT?" THE FLY WANTED TO KNOW.     "THAT'S A GOOD ZUESTION," CAPTAIN MEMORY BEGAN. "YES SIR,THAT..."     "OKAY, OKAY," ERNIE CUT HIM OFF. HE DIDN'T WANT TO HEAR THATWHOLE THING ALL OVER AGAIN. "LET'S XUST GET OUT OF HERE, OKAY?EVERYBODY KEEPS POINTING AT US AND LAUGHING!" SURE ENOUGH, AS THEYLOOKED AROUND, THEY NOTICED THE PASSING HUNS ALL POINTING THEFOURSOME OUT TO EACH OTHER AND MAKING WHAT ERNIE WAS SURE WERESNIDE COMMENTS. ERNIE IN PARTICULAR WAS GETTING VERY SENSITIVEABOUT SNIDE COMMENTS MADE AT HIS EXPENSE. "LET'S GO, GUYS, OKAY?"HE URGED.     THEY BEGAN WALKING DOWN THE YELLOW BRICK ROAD, HEADING OUT OFTHE HUN'S CAMP.      SOON THEY WERE OUT OF THE CAMP, AND HEADING ONCE AGAIN ACROSSTHE GREEN HILLS. THE ROAD ROLLED ON BEFORE THEM, OVER HILL ANDDALE, HEADING TOWARDS ROME - MAYBE.     THE ROAD SEEMED TO STRETCH ON ENDLESSLY IN FRONT OF THEM.ERNIE SIGHED. IT LOOKED LIKE IT WAS GOING TO BE A LONG WALK.     AFTER WHAT SEEMED TO BE A VERY LONG TIME THEY NOTICEDSOMETHING UP AHEAD OF THEM. IT SEEMED TO BE A HUGE CLOUD OF DUSTHEADING ACROSS THE COUNTRYSIDE. WHATEVER IT WAS, IT WAS GOING TOCROSS THE ROAD A SHORT DISTANCE IN FRONT OF THEM.     ERNIE STRAINED HIS EYES. "CAN YOU MAKE OUT WHAT THAT IS?" HESAID TO THE FLY.     "OH WOW," SAID THE FLY. "IT'S A CATTLE DRIVE!"     "DON'T BE RIDICULOUS!" SNAPPED STERNO. "CATTLE CAN'T DRIVE!"     "NO, NO," THE FLY PROTESTED. "IT'S COWS! A WHOLE BUNCH OFCOWS!"     "`HERD' OF COWS," ERNIE CORRECTED.     "OF COURSE I'VE HEARD OF COWS!" SNAPPED STERNO. "DON'T BEINSULTING!"     "WELL, THEY'RE COMING THIS WAY," THE FLY SAID.     AS THE FOUR WALKED ALONG, THEY BEGAN TO MAKE OUT MORE CLEARLYA VAST NUMBER OF CATTLE, RAISING A HUGE CLOUD OF DUST WITH THEIRHOOVES. "WHAT ARE ALL THESE CATTLE DOING HERE?" ERNIE WONDERED.     AS IF IN ANSWER TO THAT ZUESTION, A LONE FIGURE ON A HORSECAME GALLOPING TOWARD THEM.     "HEY, IT'S A COWBOY!" THE FLY SAID CHEERFULLY. "HIYA, COWBOY!"HE WAVED.     THE COWBOY GALLOPED UP TO THEM AND STOPPED. "HOWDY! ANY OF YOUBOYS KNOW THE WAY TO ABILENE?"     ERNIE LOOKED AROUND. "UH, SORRY. I'M A STRANGER HERE MYSELF."     THE COWBOY SCRATCHED HIS HEAD. "THIS COUNTRY DON'T LOOK AT ALLFAMILIAR! WE AIN'T SEEN A THING WE RECOGNIXE FER ZUITE A SPELL,NOW. Y'ALL KNOW WHERE THIS HERE ROAD LEADS?"     ERNIE THOUGHT A MOMENT. "UH, I THINK IT LEADS TO ROME, BUT I'MNOT SURE."     THE COWBOY CONSIDERED THAT. "ROME? IS THAT IN KANSAS?"     "I DON'T THINK SO," ERNIE SAID.      THE COWBOY STROKED HIS HORSE'S MUXXLE. "WELL, TOTO," HE SAIDTO HIS HORSE. "I DON'T THINK WE'RE IN KANSAS ANYMORE!" HE TURNEDBACK TO ERNIE. "WELL, THANK YA'LL KINDLY!" HE SAID, TIPPING HISHAT. HE GALLOPED BACK TO REXOIN THE HERD.     ERNIE TURNED TO CAPTAIN MEMORY. "WHAT DO YOU MAKE OF THAT?"     "TSK, TSK," THE CAPTAIN SHOOK HIS HEAD. "THE FILE CORRUPTIONIS GETTING REALLY SEVERE. MORE AND MORE DATA IS TURNING UP IN THEWRONG SECTOR. I REALLY DON'T KNOW IF THE SYSTEM IS GOING TO BE ABLETO STAND MUCH MORE OF THIS!"     ERNIE FOUND THIS COMMENT DISTURBING. "WHY? WHAT'LL HAPPENTHEN?"     THE CAPTAIN SHOOK HIS HEAD SADLY. "WELL...WELL, IT MIGHT..."HE TRAILED OFF.     ERNIE HATED IT WHEN PEOPLE TRAILED OFF. IT ALWAYS MADE HIMTERRIBLY UNEASY. "IT MIGHT...WHAT?" HE PROMPTED.     CAPTAIN MEMORY LOOKED UNCOMFORTABLE. "ARE YOU SURE YOU WANT TOKNOW?"     ERNIE THOUGHT ABOUT THIS FOR A MOMENT, AND DECIDED THE CAPTAINWAS RIGHT: HE DIDN'T WANT TO KNOW.      THE FLY, HOWEVER, HAD BECOME INTERESTED IN THE SUBXECT. "OH,I GET IT, WE'RE SUPPOSED TO GUESS, RIGHT?" HE SAID BRIGHTLY. "FIRSTSYLLABLE? SOUNDS LIKE?" HE BEGAN GESTICULATING IN A PECULIAR WAY,AS THOUGH TRYING TO ACT OUT SOME UNKNOWN WORD. "THIS IS FUN!"     STERNO GRIMACED. "WILL YOU PLEASE STOP MAKING THOSE DISGUSTINGMOTIONS? I CAN'T EVEN BEGIN TO TELL YOU HOW UTTERLY OFFENSIVE THEYLOOK!"     THE FLY PAID NO ATTENTION. "I KNOW, I KNOW, IT'S A MOVIE STAR,RIGHT?" HE BEGAN PRANCING ABOUT IN A VERY DISCONCERTING MANNER. "ISIT A DANCER, HUH? A DANCER?"     "WELL, NO..." CAPTAIN MEMORY LOOKED VERY UNCOMFORTABLE.     "I KNOW! I KNOW!" THE FLY XUMPED UP AND DOWN EXCITEDLY. "IT'SFRED ASTAIRE, RIGHT? FRED ASTAIRE?"     "UH, NO..." CAPTAIN MEMORY SHIFTED ABOUT AWKWARDLY.     "GENE KELLY!" THE FLY SHOUTED EXCITEDLY. "IT'S GENE KELLY,RIGHT?"     "UH-UH." THE CAPTAIN LOOKED AT THE GROUND.     "FOR HEAVEN SAKE'S, TELL HIM ALREADY!" SNAPPED STERNO."NOTHING ELSE IS GOING TO SHUT HIM UP!"     ERNIE WINCED. HE REALLY DIDN'T WANT TO HEAR THIS. IF IT WASBAD ENOUGH FOR CAPTAIN MEMORY TO WARN HIM ABOUT, IT MUST BE REALLYTERRIBLE. ESPECIALLY CONSIDERING ALL THE TERRIBLE THINGS THECAPTAIN HAD TOLD HIM WITHOUT WARNING HIM. HE SHUDDERED. NO, HEDEFINITELY DIDN'T WANT TO HEAR THIS.     CAPTAIN MEMORY LOOKED VERY UNHAPPY. "IT'S...UH..."     "I KNOW! I KNOW!" THE FLY WAS TOTALLY INVOLVED WITH THE GAME."CARMEN MIRANDA! IT'S CARMEN MIRANDA, RIGHT?"     CAPTAIN MEMORY SIGHED. "IT'S...WELL, IT'S...TOTAL SYSTEMFAILURE!"     THE FLY WAS TOTALLY TAKEN ABACK. "HUH? SISTER FAILURE? WHO'SSHE?" HE SULKED. "IT'S NOT FAIR TO USE PEOPLE WHO AREN'T FAMOUS!HOW AM I SUPPOSED TO GUESS THAT? WHAT MOVIES HAS SHE BEEN IN,ANYWAY?"     ERNIE SIGHED WITH RELIEF. SYSTEM FAILURE. WELL, THAT WASN'TTHAT BAD! HE FROWNED. IT SUDDENLY OCCURRED TO HIM THAT HE MIGHTFEEL DIFFERENTLY IF HE HAD ANY IDEA WHAT A `SYSTEM FAILURE' WAS."WHAT..." HE STARTED TO SAY, THEN STOPPED. ON SECOND THOUGHT,PERHAPS HE'D RATHER NOT KNOW.     "WHAT IN THE WORLD IS A `TOTAL SYSTEM FAILURE' SUPPOSED TOBE?" STERNO DEMANDED IRRITATEDLY.     CAPTAIN MEMORY SIGHED. "THAT'S WHEN YOU TOTALLY EXCEED THEOPERATING PARAMETERS OF THE SYSTEM, TO THE POINT WHERE NOT EVEN THEMULTIPLE-REDUNDANT NEURAL-NET BACKUPS CAN COMPENSATE FOR IT ANYMORE."     "HUH?" ERNIE WASN'T FOLLOWING THAT.     "WELL," CAPTAIN MEMORY SIMPLIFIED. "IT'S SORT OF LIKE THESYSTEM HAS A HEART ATTACK."     ERNIE THOUGHT ABOUT THAT. "AND, IF THE SYSTEM HAS A HEARTATTACK..."     "THEN WE HAVE A HEART ATTACK," STERNO FINISHED FOR HIM.     ERNIE MOANED ZUIETLY. HE'D HAD A FEELING IT WAS GOING TO BESOMETHING LIKE THIS. WHY DID THEY HAVE TO TELL HIM THIS, ANYWAY?WHAT WAS HE, ERNIE, SUPPOSED TO DO ABOUT IT? WHAT DID THEY HAVE TOTELL HIM IF THERE WASN'T ANYTHING HE COULD DO ABOUT IT? HIS STOMACHHURT. HE DECIDED TO TRY TO THINK ABOUT SOMETHING ELSE.     THEIR PATH WAS NOW BLOCKED BY THE HERD, FORCING THE FOURSOMETO COOL THEIR HEELS AND WAIT FOR THE ANIMALS TO PASS. THEY WAITEDWHILE THOUSANDS OF CATTLE WENT BY, RAISING A HUGE CLOUD OF CHOKINGDUST. FINALLY, THE HERD PASSED AND THE FOUR CONTINUED ON THEIR WAY.       THEY WALKED FOR WHAT ONCE AGAIN SEEMED A VERY LONG TIME,FINDING NOTHING. FINALLY, THE FLY NOTICED SOMETHING. "SEEMS TO BESOMETHING GOING ON UP AHEAD," HE COMMENTED. "LOOKS LIKE A CHARIOTPULLED OVER BY THE SIDE OF THE ROAD."     AS THE FOURSOME APPROACHED, THEY COULD SEE THAT IT INDEED WASA CHARIOT. FOUR ROMANS IN TOGAS STOOD AROUND IT. A TIRE ON ONE OFTHE WHEELS SEEMED TO HAVE GONE FLAT, AND THEY WERE PUMPING IT UPWITH A HAND PUMP. ERNIE FROWNED. "ARE CHARIOTS SUPPOSED TO HAVETIRES?"      THE FLY LOOKED AT THE CHARIOT. "HEY, IT'S GOT OLD-FASHIONEDSKINNY TIRES ON SPOKED WHEELS, LIKE A MODEL T FORD. WHAT DO YOUEXPECT?"      "I DUNNO." ERNIE WAS TRYING HARD TO REMEMBER WHAT THECHARIOTS LOOKED LIKE IN THE GLADIATOR MOVIES, HOWEVER HE HADN'TBEEN PAYING ATTENTION THAT CLOSELY. "WITH ALL THE STUFF THAT'S BEENHAPPENING, YOU CAN'T BE TOO CAREFUL!"     "DON'T BE SUCH A WORRY WART!" SNAPPED STERNO. "SUPPOSE IT ISA PHONY CHARIOT, WHAT DIFFERENCE DOES IT MAKE?"     "UH..." ERNIE HADN'T THOUGHT THAT FAR AHEAD. HIS THOUGHTS WEREINTERRUPTED BY ONE OF THE ROMANS WHO APPROACHED THEM. HE WAS ATALL, THIN MAN, WEARING A TOGA. HE SEEMED LIKE A TYPICAL ROMAN OUTOF A GLADIATOR MOVIE, EXCEPT FOR THE FACT THAT HE WORE A MONOCLEAND XACKBOOTS.     THE MAN'S ARM SWEPT OUT IN A ROMAN SALUTE. "HEIL...I MEAN,HAIL!" HE SAID CHEERFULLY. ERNIE FROWNED. WEREN'T ROMANS SUPPOSEDTO WEAR SANDALS?     THE MAN CONTINUED. "VE CHUST FINISHED FIXING OUR CHARIOT.PERHAPS YOU VOULD LIKE A RIDE, XA?"     "YOU BET!" SAID THE FLY ENTHUSIASTICALLY. "BOY, I'M REALLYSICK OF WALKING!"     "WELL, I DUNNO..." SAID ERNIE. SOMETHING ABOUT THIS XUSTDIDN'T SEEM RIGHT TO HIM. HE LOOKED AT THE TWO WHITE HORSES THATTHE CHARIOT WAS HITCHED TO, CAREFULLY EXAMINING THEM FOR ANY SIGNOF SEAMS OR LUMPINESS. NO, THEY LOOKED OKAY. PERFECTLY FORMED, WITHNO SEAMS. ONE THING DID SEEM ODD ABOUT THEM, THOUGH: THEY DIDN'TMOVE AT ALL. THEY STOOD ABSOLUTELY STILL, LIKE STATUES. BUT THEN,ON THE OTHER HAND, ERNIE DIDN'T REALLY KNOW THAT MUCH ABOUT HORSES.MAYBE THEY WERE SUPPOSED TO STAND LIKE THAT. IT PROBABLY DIDN'TMEAN ANYTHING.     "OH, COME ON!" SAID STERNO IMPATIENTLY. "ZUIT MAKING SUCH ANISSUE ABOUT EVERYTHING! LET'S XUST GET IN, ALL RIGHT? I'VE HAD ITWITH WALKING!"     "I BET YOU MUST BE DOG TIRED, RIGHT?" SAID THE FLY.     "SPARE ME YOUR ATTEMPTS AT HUMOR, YOU INSECTILE MORON!" STERNOBARKED.     THE FLY LOOKED UPSET. "WHAT DID HE MEAN BY THAT?" HE SAID TOERNIE.     "TIME TO GO!" URGED THE ROMAN. "ALL ABOARD, XA?"     STERNO AND THE FLY ZUICKLY SCRAMBLED ABOARD THE CHARIOT, WHICHSEEMED UNUSUALLY LARGE AND SPACIOUS TO ERNIE. HE GOT ON AS WELL, INSPITE OF HIS MISGIVINGS. CAPTAIN MEMORY BROUGHT UP THE REAR. THEOTHER THREE ROMANS THEN GOT ON BEHIND THEM, BLOCKING THE ENTRANCEAND MAKING ANY ESCAPE IMPOSSIBLE. ERNIE FELT VERY UNEASY ABOUTTHAT. HE WAS, HOWEVER, RELIEVED TO SEE THAT CAPTAIN MEMORY DID NOTSEEM THE LEAST BIT BOTHERED BY THE SITUATION. BUT THEN, CAPTAINMEMORY DIDN'T SEEM THE LEAST BIT BOTHERED BY ANY SITUATION.     "VELL, AVAY WE GO!" SAID THE ROMAN CHEERFULLY. "GIDDAP!" HESNAPPED THE REINS.     NOTHING HAPPENED. THE HORSES STOOD THERE, TOTALLY IMMOBILE.THE ROMAN LAUGHED NERVOUSLY. "GIDDY UP!" HE LASHED THE HORSES WITHTHE REINS. STILL NOTHING. FROM SOMEWHERE IN HIS TOGA HE PRODUCED ARIDING CROP, AND BEGAN LASHING THE HORSES UNMERCIFULLY. "YOU VILLMOVE, YOU SHTUPID ANIMALS!" THE HORSES STOOD ABSOLUTELY STILL,TOTALLY UNRESPONSIVE.     THE ROMAN TURNED TO THE FOURSOME WITH A NERVOUS LAUGH. "ALIDDLE PROBLEM, NOTHING TO VORRY ABOUT! NO NEED TO GET OUT!" HEXUMPED OVER THE SIDE OF THE CHARIOT, AND APPROACHED THE HORSESMENACINGLY.     "UH, HERR STURMBANNFUHRER," ONE OF THE OTHER ROMANS SPOKE UP."THERE IS SOMETHING VE FORGOT TO TELL YOU..."     THE FIRST ROMAN GAVE THE CLOSEST HORSE A SWIFT KICK IN THEHIND LEG. THE LEG BROKE NEATLY OFF. THE ROMAN XUMPED FRANTICALLYOUT OF THE WAY AS THE HORSE TOPPLED SLOWLY OVER AND CRASHED TO THEPAVEMENT, SHATTERING INTO A MILLION PIECES.     THE FIRST ROMAN TURNED ON THE OTHER ROMANS IN A FURY."IDIOTS!" HE SHRIEKED. "YOU BROUGHT XE PLASTER HORSES! I TOLD YOU,VE MUST HAVE XE REAL HORSES!"     "BUT, BUT HERR STURMBANNFUHRER," THE SECOND ROMAN SPUTTERED."XE REAL HORSES, XEY MAKE DOO-DOO ON XE FLOOR!"     "DUMMKOPF!" SHRIEKED THE FIRST ROMAN. "HOW CAN VE TRAVEL VITHPLASTER HORSES?"     THE OTHER THREE ROMAN LOOKED AT EACH OTHER IN DISMAY. "OH. VEDIDN'T TINK OF DAT."     "IDIOTS!" THE FIRST ROMAN LASHED THE OTHERS WITH HIS RIDINGCROP.     "OH MAN!" SAID THE FLY SADLY. "DOES THIS MEAN WE'RE GONNA HAVETO WALK AFTER ALL?"     THE FIRST ROMAN STOPPED ABRUPTLY, AND TURNED TO THE FOURSOMEWITH A BRIGHT SMILE. "OH NO, OF COURSE NOT! DIS IS CHUST A MINORPROBLEM, VE FIX IN CHUST A MOMENT!" THE ROMAN PULLED SOME SORT OFSMALL ELECTRONIC DEVICE OUT OF HIS TOGA, AND SCANNED THESURROUNDING AREA WITH IT. IT BEEPED. "AH! XE SOLUTION TO OURPROBLEM IS COMING RIGHT DOWN XE ROAD!"     AN OBXECT APPEARED OVER THE HORIXON, MOVING ZUICKLY DOWN THEROAD IN THEIR DIRECTION. AS IT APPROACHED, ERNIE COULD SEE THAT ITWAS A LARGE CHARIOT, PULLED BY FOUR BEAUTIFUL WHITE HORSES. ITLOOKED SOMEHOW FAMILIAR.     THE FOUR ROMANS STOOD IN THE MIDDLE OF THE ROAD, BLOCKING THEPATH AS THE CHARIOT APROACHED. THE MAN IN THE CHARIOT STOPPED,CONFUSED.     "YOU!" THE FIRST ROMAN SHOUTED. "OUT OF XE CHARIOT! NOW!" HEPULLED AN EVIL-LOOKING WEAPON OUT OF HIS TOGA, AND POINTED IT ATTHE MAN IN THE CHARIOT MENACINGLY.     "MAKE WAY! MAKE WAY!" THE MAN IN THE CHARIOT CRIED OUT. "I HAVE NO TIME TO WASTE! I'M ON MY WAY TO THE CHARIOT RACES IN ROME!"THE MAN IN THE CHARIOT LOOKED VERY FAMILIAR TO ERNIE. COULD ITBE...CHARLTON HESTON?     "I HAVE NO TIME TO VASTE, EITHER!" THE FIRST ROMAN FIRED HISWEAPON AT THE MAN IN THE CHARIOT, WHO VANISHED IN A FLASH OF FLAME."NOW," HE TURNED TO ERNIE AND THE OTHERS. "VE VILL TAKE XISCHARIOT, XA?"     "OH MAN!" SAID THE FLY MOURNFULLY. "THEY'RE RUINING ALL MYFAVORITE SHOWS! FIRST MR. ED FALLS APART, AND NOW THEY DISINTEGRATEBEN-HUR!"     EVEN STERNO WAS NOW BEGINNING TO GET SUSPICIOUS. "SAY," HESAID TO THE FIRST ROMAN. "WHAT'S YOUR NAME, ANYWAY?"     "MY NAME?" THE FIRST ROMAN SEEMED NONPLUSSED. "YOU VANT TOKNOW MY NAME?"     "YEAH!" ERNIE PICKED THE ZUESTION UP. "WHAT'S YOUR NAME?"     THE FIRST ROMAN LAUGHED NERVOUSLY. HE ELBOWED THE SECOND ROMANSHARPLY. "ZUICK!" HE WHISPERED. "VOT'S MY NAME?!" THE SECOND ROMANWHISPERED SOMETHING TO HIM. THE FIRST ROMAN SMILED AGREEABLY. "OHYES, MY NAME! I AM MARCUS PROVOLONICUS."     STERNO FROXE IN HORROR. "PROVOLONE...IT'S CHEESE! OH MY GOD,IT'S CHEESE! RUN!"     THE OTHER THREE ROMANS SUDDENLY WHIPPED OUT EVIL-LOOKINGWEAPONS. "DO NOT MOVE!" SHRIEKED THE FIRST ROMAN. "OR YOU VILLSUFFER XE SAME FATE AS OUR FRIEND HERE!" HE GESTURED TOWARDS THEOTHER CHARIOT, WHICH NOW CONTAINED ONLY A LITTLE PILE OF ASHES.     THE FIRST ROMAN TORE OFF HIS TOGA, REVEALING A NAXI SS UNIFORMUNDERNEATH. "SO, OUR LIDDLE SUBTERFUGE DOES NOT FOOL YOU, EH?" HESAID MENACINGLY. "DAT IS MOST...UNFORTUNATE. FOR VHICH..." HELOOKED AROUND ZUICKLY. HIS EYES CAME TO REST ON THE SECOND ROMAN."...YOU VILL PAY, DUMMKOPF!" HE LASHED THE MAN WITH HIS RIDINGCROP.     "BUT, HERR STURMBANNFUHRER..." THE MAN BEGAN.     "SILENCE!" SHRIEKED VON LIEDERKRANX. "IT IS IMPOSSIBLE TO GETGOOD HELP XESE DAYS!" HE SULKED. "XE ZUALITY OF XE CYBERSLAVES ISNOT VHAT IT USED TO BE!"      HE TURNED TO ERNIE AND THE OTHERS. "NOW, YOU VILL GET ON XISCHARIOT, AND VE VILL BE ON OUR VAY!" ERNIE LOOKED AT VONLIEDERKRANX'S EVIL-LOOKING WEAPONS, AND DECIDED TO DO IT THE NAXI'SWAY. THEY BOARDED THE OTHER CHARIOT. THIS TIME, THE HORSES WORKED,AND THEY MOVED OFF ZUICKLY DOWN THE ROAD.     "HEY, THIS SURE BEATS WALKING!" SAID THE FLY CHEERFULLY, ASTHEY THUNDERED ALONG THE YELLOW BRICK ROAD.     "I DUNNO," SAID ERNIE RUEFULLY. "CONSIDERING WHERE WE'REGOING, MAYBE WE'D RATHER WALK." ERNIE FROWNED. "SAY," HE SAID TOVON LIEDERKRANX. "WHERE ARE WE GOING, ANYWAY?"     VON LIEDERKRANX SMILED EVILLY. "YOU'LL FIND OUT SOON ENOUGH!"     ERNIE LOOKED ON AHEAD. THEY APPEARED TO BE APPROACHINGSOMETHING. "OH, IT'S A TOWN!" SAID THE FLY.     "VOT!" VON LIEDERKRANX SNAPPED. "DERE'S NOT SUPPOSED TO BE ATOWN HERE! WHOA!" HE STOPPED THE CHARIOT. "VHERE'S MY MAP?" HEPULLED OUT A MAP AND BEGAN REGARDING IT CAREFULLY. "AH, HERE'S DEPROBLEM! VE GET ON XE AUTOBAHN, UND TURN LEFT AT HEIDELBERG..."     THE OTHER ROMANS HAD REMOVED THEIR TOGAS AS WELL, AND STOODREVEALED AS NAXI SS TROOPERS. ONE OF THEM PEERED OVER VONLIEDERKRANX'S SHOULDER. "UH, HERR STURMBANNFUHRER," HE BEGANTENTATIVELY. "DAT'S A MAP OF BAVARIA!"     VON LIEDERKRANX STARTED. HE LOOKED AT THE LEGEND OF THE MAP,AND THEN CRUMPLED IT UP ANGRILY AND THREW IT ON THE GROUND. "I KNOWDAT!" HE SNAPPED. "I VAS CHUST...TESTING YOU. VERY GOOD!" HEPRODDED THE SS TROOPER WITH HIS RIDING CROP. "OKAY, MR. KNOW-IT-ALL, VHERE DO VE GO NOW?"     THE TROOPER REGARDED THE ROAD CAREFULLY. "VELL, SINCE DERE'SONLY ONE ROAD, AND DIS ISN'T DE RIGHT VAY, I VOULD SAY VE GO...DEOTHER WAY!"     VON LIEDERKRANX THOUGHT A MINUTE. "UH...RIGHT! DE OTHER VAY!VE GO DE OTHER VAY!" HE WHEELED THE CHARIOT AROUND AND THEYGALLOPED OFF IN THE OTHER DIRECTION.     THEY CHARGED ON DOWN THE YELLOW BRICK ROAD IN THE DIRECTIONFROM WHICH THEY HAD COME IN THE FIRST PLACE, MOVING FASTER THISTIME AS VON LIEDERKRANX WHIPPED THE HORSES BAD-TEMPEREDLY. AFTERSOME TIME, THEY BEGAN TO APPROACH WHAT SEEMED TO BE A TOWN.     "OH WOW," SAID THE FLY. "IT'S THE SAME TOWN! HOW DID WE GET TOTHE SAME PLACE WHEN WE WENT THE OPPOSITE DIRECTION?"     "I TOLD YOU SO," SMIRKED STERNO. "`ALL ROADS LEAD TO ROME'.YOU'RE XUST GOING TO HAVE TO GO THERE. THERE'S XUST NO GETTING OUTOF IT."     VON LIEDERKRANX PEERED AHEAD. "GOTTVERDAMMTER! VHERE'S MYMAP?" HE PULLED OUT ANOTHER MAP AND REGARDED IT CAREFULLY. "AH!HERE'S XE PROBLEM! VE CHUST GET ON I-94, TURN RIGHT ATINDIANAPOLIS..."     THE SS TROOPER LOOKED OVER VON LIEDERKRANX'S SHOULDER AGAIN."UH, HERR STURMBANNFUHRER, DAT'S A MAP OF ILLINOIS!" VONLIEDERKRANX STARTED. HE ZUICKLY CRUMPLED UP THE MAP AND THREW IT ONTHE GROUND. "I KNOW DAT!" HE TURNED TO THE REST OF THE GROUP. "VEARE GOING TO XIS TOWN! VE INTENDED TO GO TO XIS TOWN! IT VAS NOT AMISTAKE!" THEY CONTINUED DOWN THE ROAD, AND INTO TOWN.     THE TOWN CONSISTED OF ONE UNPAVED ROAD, FLANKED BY ONE STORYWOODEN BUILDINGS WITH BROAD FRONTS. THEIR NAMES WERE CLEARLYLEGIBLE ON THEM: SALOON, GENERAL STORE, U.S. MARSHAL. THE TOWNLOOKED SOMEHOW FAMILIAR TO ERNIE.     "OH WOW!" EXCLAIMED THE FLY. "IT'S DODGE CITY!"     "THAT'S IMPOSSIBLE!" SNORTED STERNO. "YOU CAN'T HAVE `ALLROADS LEAD TO DODGE CITY'! THAT'S NOT RIGHT! I HAVE A CLASSICALEDUCATION AND I KNOW!"     "COULD BE ABILENE, I SUPPOSE," MUSED ERNIE.     "`ALL ROADS LEAD TO ABILENE'?" SAID STERNO SARCASTICALLY. "FATCHANCE!"     "YOU MUST BE RIGHT," ERNIE AGREED. "I DON'T SEE ANY CATTLEAROUND. MUST BE DODGE CITY AFTER ALL!"     AS THEY PASSED THROUGH TOWN, ERNIE NOTICED A TALL, THIN YOUNGMAN WHO LOOKED AT THEM WITH ALARM. THE YOUNG MAN BEGAN HURRYINGTOWARDS THE U.S. MARSHAL'S OFFICE, WALKING WITH A PRONOUNCED LIMP."MR. DILLON! MR. DILLON! SOMETHIN' STRANGE COMIN' INTO TOWN!" HECRIED.     A TALL, IMPOSING MAN, DRESSED IN WESTERN ATTIRE AND WEARING AU.S. MARSHAL BADGE STEPPED OUT OF THE MARSHAL'S OFFICE AND INTO THESTREET, BLOCKING THE PATH OF THE CHARIOT. "HOLD UP THERE, NOW! WHATDO YOU BOYS WANT IN OUR TOWN?"     "GET OUT OF MY VAY!" HISSED VON LIEDERKRANX. "I HAFF NO TIMEFOR DIS SHTUPIDITY!"     "NOW HOLD ON XUST A MINUTE THERE..." THE MARSHAL BEGAN.      "IDIOT!" SNAPPED VON LIEDERKRANX. HE TURNED TO THE SSTROOPERS. "DISINTEGRATE HIM!" VON LIEDERKRANX AND THE SS TROOPERSREACHED FOR THEIR EVIL-LOOKING WEAPONS.     WITH LIGHTNING SPEED, THE MARSHAL'S GUN FLEW INTO HIS HAND.FOUR SHOTS RAND OUT, CATCHING EACH OF THE NAXIS FULL IN THE CHEST,THE FORCE OF THE BULLET HURLING THEIR BODIES FROM THE CHARIOT.     "I SEEN IT, MR. DILLON!" CRIED CHESTER, THE YOUNG MAN WITH THELIMP. "THEY DREW FIRST!"     ERNIE THREW HIS HANDS UP OVER HIS HEAD. "DON'T SHOOT! WE'REUNARMED!"     STERNO GET DOWN ON ALL FOURS. "WOOF!" HE SAID EMPHATICALLY."THEY DON'T SHOOT DOGS, DO THEY?"     "THEY WERE HOLDING US PRISONER!" THE FLY CHIMED IN. "THEY SHOTBEN-HUR!"     "BEN WHO?" THE MARSHAL LOOKED CONFUSED. XUST THEN, A WOMAN INAN ELABORATE RED DRESS RAN OUT OF THE SALOON. "OH MATT! ARE YOU ALLRIGHT? I HEARD THE SHOOTING..."     "DON'T YOU WORRY, MISS KITTY, I'M XUST FINE," THE MARSHALREASSURED HER.     ERNIE LOOKED AT THE GROUND BEHIND HIM. THE BLOODY BODIES OFVON LIEDERKRANX AND THE OTHER NAXIS WERE LYING MOTIONLESS IN THEDUST.     ERNIE TURNED TO CAPTAIN MEMORY. "ARE THEY REALLY...DEAD?"     "OH YES," SAID CAPTAIN MEMORY CHEERFULLY. "TOO BAD THEY WON'TSTAY THAT WAY!"     "HUH?" ERNIE WAS CONFUSED.     "WELL, YOU KNOW HOW IT IS IN COMPUTER GAMES," THE CAPTAIN WENTON. "IF YOU GET KILLED, YOU XUST START OVER AGAIN WITH ANOTHERLIFE!"     "I DUNNO, THEY LOOKED PRETTY DEAD TO ME!" ERNIE SAID.     "LOOK AGAIN," THE CAPTAIN ADVISED.     ERNIE TURNED. THE BODIES HAD VANISHED.      "SEE?" THE CAPTAIN SAID. "THEY'VE GONE BACK TO THE BEGINNING.THEY'LL HAVE TO START ALL OVER!"     ERNIE TURNED BACK TO LOOK AT THE MARSHAL, WHO HAD BEENCONFERRING WITH MISS KITTY AND CHESTER. "YOU BOYS ARE FREE TO GO,"THE MARSHAL SAID. "XUST STAY OUT OF TROUBLE!" HE WENT BACK INTO HISOFFICE.     "WHEW!" THE FLY BREATHED A SIGH OF RELIEF. "BOY, ARE WE LUCKYTO GET OUT OF THAT ONE! YOU DON'T WANT TO MESS WITH MARSHALDILLON!"     STERNO STOOD BACK UP AND BRUSHED HIMSELF OFF, TRYING TORECOVER HIS LOST DIGNITY. "YOU CAN PUT YOUR HANDS DOWN NOW," HESAID TO ERNIE SNAPPISHLY. "YOU HAVE NO IDEA HOW RIDICULOUS YOU LOOKSURRENDERING WHEN THERE'S NO-ONE THERE!"     "OH." ERNIE LOWERED HIS HANDS. HE LOOKED AROUND. "SO, WHAT AREWE GONNA DO IN DODGE CITY?"     THE FLY LOOKED AT THE SALOON. "LOOK AT ALL THOSE PRETTY GIRLSIN THERE! WHADDYA SAY WE GO IN FOR A DRINK?"     "WELL...OKAY." ERNIE COULDN'T THINK OF ANY REASON NOT TO.BESIDES, HIS THROAT WAS FEELING PRETTY DUSTY AFTER THAT LONGCHARIOT RIDE.     THEY GOT OUT OF THE CHARIOT AND WALKED TOWARDS THE SALOON, THEFLY LEADING THE WAY. THEY WALKED UP TO THE DOORS, WHEN SUDDENLYTHEIR WAY WAS BLOCKED BY A BURLY BARTENDER. "HOLD IT RIGHT THERE,BOYS! WE DON'T ALLOW NO INXUNS IN HERE!"     "HUH?" THE FLY WAS CONFUSED.     "THAT MEANS YOU!" THE BARTENDER PRODDED THE FLY IN THE CHEST."IMAGINE THAT, TRYING TO COME IN HERE WITH FEATHERS..." HE GESTUREDTOWARD THE FLY'S ANTENNA, "...AND A WAR MASK!" HE GESTURED TOWARDSTHE FLY'S FACE. THE DANCE-HALL GIRLS LAUGHED DERISIVELY.     "HEY, WAIT A MINUTE!" THE FLY PROTESTED. "I'M NOT..."     A SHOTGUN SUDDENLY APPEARED IN THE BARTENDER'S HANDS. "I SAID`GIT!'" HE SAID MENACINGLY. "NOW!"     "OKAY, OKAY," THE FLY BACKED OFF. "I'M GITTIN'!"     "AND DON'T COME BACK!" THE BARTENDER CALLED AFTER THEM.     THE FLY SIGHED AS THE FOURSOME WALKED BACK TO THE CHARIOT."AW, GEE. I NEVER GET TO HAVE ANY FUN!"                          8     THE FOURSOME WALKED SLOWLY BACK TOWARDS BEN-HUR'S CHARIOT.SUDDENLY, THE LEAD HORSE REARED UP, WHINNYING LOUDLY, AND THE FOURHORSES GALLOPED OUT OF TOWN AS FAST AS THEY COULD RUN, THE EMPTYCHARIOT BOUNCING ALONG BEHIND THEM.     ERNIE WAS TOTALLY TAKEN ABACK BY THIS. "HEY, THEY STARTED UPALL BY THEMSELVES!" HE SAID, AS THE CLOUD OF DUST RAISED BY THEHORSE'S HOOVES DRIFTED OVER THEM. "CAN THEY DO THAT?"     "WELL, OBVIOUSLY THEY CAN!" STERNO SNEERED. "AND IT'S ALL YOURFAULT!"     "MY FAULT!" ERNIE COUGHED. "WHY IS IT MY FAULT?"     "BECAUSE IT'S ALWAYS YOUR FAULT!" STERNO SNAPPED. "YOU DIDN'TTIE THEM UP!"     "ME?" ERNIE PROTESTED. "I DIDN'T KNOW YOU HAD TO TIE THEM UP!CAN'T YOU XUST, LIKE, TURN THEM OFF OR SOMETHING?"     STERNO ROLLED HIS EYES UPWARD. "HOPELESS!"     CAPTAIN MEMORY LOOKED UP AT THE BRIGHT AFTERNOON SUN. "NICEDAY FOR A WALK, DON'T YOU THINK?"     ERNIE LOOKED DOWN THE ROAD. IT SEEMED TO STRETCH ENDLESSLYTHROUGH A SCRUBBY, DUSTY, SEMI-DESERT LANDSCAPE. IT LOOKED EXACTLYLIKE THE SCENERY HE'D SEEN IN HUNDREDS OF EPISODES OF "GUNSMOKE".IT DID NOT LOOK LIKE A PLEASANT PLACE FOR A WALK. "MAYBE WE COULDXUST STAY HERE," HE SUGGESTED HOPEFULLY.     XUST THEN, MARSHAL DILLON STEPPED OUT OF HIS OFFICE. "YOU BOYSBETTER GET MOVIN', BEFORE YOU GET INTO MORE TROUBLE," HE SAIDSTERNLY. "I WANT YOU OUT OF TOWN BEFORE SUNSET!"     ERNIE SIGHED. "WELL, OKAY, MAYBE WE WON'T STAY HERE, THEN."THE FOURSOME STARTED OFF DOWN THE ROAD, OCCASIONALLY GLANCING OVERTHEIR SHOULDERS TO SEE IF THE MARSHAL WAS STILL WATCHING THEM.UNFORTUNATELY, HE WAS.     AFTER WHAT SEEMED LIKE HOURS, THEY APPROACHED A FORK IN THEROAD. ONE BRANCH SEEMED TO HEAD OFF INTO THE MOUNTAINS, AND ANOTHERINTO THE VALLEY. THEY STOPPED.     ERNIE LOOKED AT BOTH BRANCHES OF THE ROAD. "WELL, WHICH WAY DOWE GO? THE HIGH ROAD OR THE LOW ROAD?"     "I KNOW!" THE FLY CHIMED IN BRIGHTLY. "YOU TAKE THE HIGH ROADAND I'LL TAKE THE LOW ROAD!"     "WHY?"     "BECAUSE THEN I'LL BE IN SCOTLAND AFORE YE!" THE FLY BEAMED.     "GIMME A BREAK", MOANED ERNIE.     "WAIT A MINUTE," CAPTAIN MEMORY INTERRUPTED.     "WHAT?" MAYBE THE CAPTAIN COULD COME UP WITH SOMETHING THATWOULD GET THEM OUT OF THIS DESOLATE LANDSCAPE.     "ISN'T IT SUPPOSED TO BE `YOU'LL TAKE THE LOW ROAD AND I'LLTAKE THE HIGH ROAD?'"     THE FLY FROWNED. "NO, I'M SURE IT'S SUPPOSED TO BE `YOU TAKETHE HIGH ROAD AND I'LL TAKE THE LOW ROAD'!"     CAPTAIN MEMORY SHOOK HIS HEAD. "NO, I THINK IT'S THE OTHER WAYAROUND!"     "NO, IT CAN'T BE!" THE FLY ANSWERED. "LISTEN!" HE STARTED TOSING. "YOU'LL TAKE THE HIGH ROAD..."     "THAT'S ENOUGH ALREADY!" STERNO BROKE IN. "WHAT DIFFERENCEDOES IT MAKE, ANYWAY! WE'RE NOT GOING TO SCOTLAND!"     ERNIE LOOKED AROUND. "OKAY, THEN WHERE ARE WE GOING?"     "ROME!" STATED STERNO CONFIDENTLY. "`ALL ROADS LEAD TO ROME!'"     ERNIE REGARDED THE LANDSCAPE SKEPTICALLY. "I DUNNO. ROME,THAT'S IN ITALY, RIGHT? THIS DOESN'T LOOK LIKE ITALY TO ME. ITLOOKS LIKE..." HE STOPPED.     "LIKE WHAT?" STERNO DEMANDED.     "LIKE...WELL, WELL...I DON'T KNOW WHAT IT LOOKS LIKE, BUT ITDOESN'T LOOK LIKE ITALY."     "IT'S POINTLESS TO ARGUE WITH ME," SAID STERNO POMPOUSLY."BECAUSE I HAVE A CLASSICAL EDUCATION AND I AM, THEREFORE, ALWAYSRIGHT."     "AREN'T THERE SUPPOSED TO BE, LIKE, GRAPES, AND PIXXAS, ANDPEOPLE PLAYING THOSE LITTLE ACCORDIONS?" ERNIE WONDERED. NO-ONEPAID ANY ATTENTION TO HIM.     THE FLY LOOKED DOWN THE ROAD INTO THE VALLEY, AND UP THE ROADINTO THE MOUNTAINS. "OKAY, SO WHICH WAY DO WE GO, THEN?"     "IT DOESN'T MATTER," SAID STERNO SELF-IMPORTANTLY. "`ALL ROADSLEAD TO ROME'!"     THE FLY STARTED UP THE ROAD INTO THE MOUNTAINS. "YOU GUYS CANGO ANY WAY YOU WANT," HE CALLED BACK OVER HIS SHOULDER. "BUT I'MGOING THIS WAY!"     "WHY?" ERNIE CALLED AFTER HIM.     "'CAUSE THEN I'LL BE IN SCOTLAND AFORE YE!" THE FLY LAUGHEDAND STARTED RUNNING. "LAST ONE THERE IS A ROTTEN EGG!"     ERNIE TURNED TO CAPTAIN MEMORY AND STERNO. "WELL," HE SAID ATLAST. "I GUESS WE MIGHT AS WELL FOLLOW HIM."     "I'LL SAY!" CAPTAIN MEMORY AGREED. "I WOULDN'T WANT HIM TO BEIN SCOTLAND AFORE ME!" THE THREE OF THEM TURNED, AND BEGAN WALKINGUP THE ROAD INTO THE MOUNTAINS.     THE ROAD HEADED UPWARD AT A MODERATE ANGLE, MAKING WALKINGSOMEWHAT DIFFICULT. THEY BEGAN TO NOTICE THE TERRAIN AROUND THEMCHANGING AS THEY WALKED. THEY SEEMED TO BE MOVING INTO A COOLER,MOISTER ENVIRONMENT. THE DESERT WAS GIVING WAY TO COOL ALPINEMEADOWS. THE ROAD NARROWED INTO A PATH, THREADING IT'S WAY BETWEENTHE GROWING HILLS. `ACTUALLY', ERNIE THOUGHT. `IT'S KIND OF NICEHERE. MAYBE TAKING THE HIGH ROAD WAS A GOOD IDEA.'     THEY HAD NOT SEEN THE FLY FOR ZUITE SOME TIME, BUT THEY WEREFAIRLY CONFIDENT THAT HE WAS XUST A BIT OUT OF SIGHT AHEAD OF THEM,SINCE THEY COULD HEAR SOMEONE SINGING "I'LL TAKE THE HIGH ROAD..."IN THE DISTANCE. SUDDENLY, THE SINGING STOPPED.     ERNIE FROWNED. HE HOPED THE FLY HADN'T FALLEN OVER A CLIFF ORSOMETHING. HE STRAINED HIS EARS. NO, NO SINGING. SUDDENLY, HE HEARDANOTHER SOUND. "DID YOU HEAR THAT?" HE SAID TO STERNO.     "OF COURSE," SAID STERNO ASSUREDLY.     ERNIE FROWNED. "WHAT DID THAT SOUND LIKE TO YOU?"     "I BELIEVE IT WAS `YODELLAY-HE-HOO'", STERNO REPLIED.     ERNIE KNITTED HIS BROW IN CONCENTRATION. "I'VE HEARD THATBEFORE. THAT REMINDS ME OF SOMETHING!"     "LIKE WHAT?" ASKED STERNO, WITH A SLIGHT AIR OF SARCASM."FONDUE, PERHAPS? CHOCOLATE? WATCHES? `HEIDI'?"     ERNIE BRIGHTENED. "SWITXERLAND! WE'RE IN SWITXERLAND!"     "VERY GOOD!" APPLAUDED STERNO. "GO TO THE HEAD OF THE CLASS!"     ERNIE FROWNED AGAIN. "SO, WHAT ARE WE DOING IN SWITXERLAND?"     CAPTAIN MEMORY SHRUGGED. "WE SEEM TO HAVE WANDERED INTOSOMEBODY'S GEOGRAPHY PROGRAM."     "SO NOW WHAT?"     "WE GO ON TO ROME, OF COURSE," STERNO ANSWERED CONFIDENTLY.     ERNIE LOOKED AT THE RISING MOUNTAINS AND ALPINE MEADOWS AROUNDTHEM. "ARE YOU SURE WE'RE GOING THE RIGHT WAY? I MEAN, ARE WESUPPOSED TO GO THROUGH SWITXERLAND TO GET TO ROME?"     "OF COURSE," SAID STERNO WITH GREAT ASSURANCE. "DON'T YOUREMEMBER HANNIBAL, TAKING HIS ELEPHANTS THROUGH THE ALPS ON HIS WAYTO ROME?"     "HANNIBAL!" ERNIE'S FACE LIT UP WITH RECOGNITION. "I SAW THATMOVIE! STARRING VICTOR MATURE, RIGHT?" ERNIE LOOKED AT THE NARROWPATH ON WHICH THEY STOOD, AND FROWNED. "WHAT ARE WE GONNA DO IF WERUN INTO AN ELEPHANT ON THIS TRAIL?"     AT THAT MOMENT THEY TURNED A CORNER, AND CAME UPON THE FLY,WHO WAS STANDING STILL, LOOKING AT SOMETHING. "HI, GUYS!" HE SAID."TAKE A LOOK AT THIS!"     THE TRAIL AT THIS POINTED ROUNDED A CURVE AT THE TOP OF ACLIFF. THE FLY POINTED OVER THE SIDE, INTO THE VALLEY BELOW. THEREWAS SOME SORT OF COMMOTION GOING ON IN THE VALLEY. THERE SEEMED TOBE A LARGE CROWD OF SOME SORT MOVING THROUGH THE VALLEY, CARRYINGTORCHES.     ERNIE PEERED INTO THE VALLEY. THERE WERE A LOT OF PEOPLE, ORANIMALS, OR SOMETHING, MOVING AROUND, BUT HE COULDN'T MAKE OUT WHATTHEY WERE DOING. "ANOTHER CATTLE DRIVE?" HE SUGGESTED.     "I DOUBT IT," REMARKED STERNO. "LOOK AT ALL THOSE TORCHES!"     "MUST BE A TORCH DRIVE!" THE FLY SAID BRIGHTLY.     STERNO GLARED AT THE FLY, AND MUTTERED SOMETHINGUNINTELLIGIBLE.     "THOSE TORCHES SURE ARE PRETTY, AREN'T THEY?" COMMENTEDCAPTAIN MEMORY. "MAYBE WE SHOULD GO DOWN AND XOIN THE PARTY?"     ERNIE COULD HEAR SOME KIND OF CHANTING DRIFTING UP FROM THEVALLEY. HE STRAINED TO HEAR WHAT THEY WERE SAYING. IT SEEMED TO BESOMETHING LIKE `OOM ALLA BOOM'. HE FROWNED. SOMEHOW, HE XUST DIDN'TLIKE THE LOOK OF THAT CROWD. "UH, MAYBE WE'D BETTER NOT," HECOUNTERED.     STERNO AGREED WITH HIM. "MAYBE ANOTHER TIME," THE DOGSUGGESTED.     CAPTAIN MEMORY LOOKED AT THE OTHERS. "YOU GUYS ARE NO FUN," HECOMPLAINED. THE FOURSOME WATCHED THE COMMOTION BELOW FOR A FEWMINUTES, AND THEN CONTINUED ALONG THE TRAIL.     THE NARROW TRAIL WOUND ALONG BETWEEN HUGE BOULDERS, MAKING ITIMPOSSIBLE TO SEE VERY FAR AHEAD. THE FOURSOME PASSED THROUGH ANARROW OPENING, AND FOUND THEMSELVES FACING A LARGE, OPEN FIELD,WHICH SEEMED TO STRETCH ON FOR MILES.      IN THE MIDDLE OF THIS SPACE WAS A LARGE, ENGLISH-STYLEMANSION, SURROUNDED BY CAREFULLY-TENDED GROUNDS. THE FOURSOMEAPPROACHED IT.     A LOW, ORNAMENTAL FENCE SURROUNDED THE GROUNDS. A ROAD LEDTHROUGH THE FENCE, AND UP TO THE FRONT DOOR. LACKING ANY BETTERIDEAS, THE FOURSOME WALKED DOWN THE ROAD AND UP TO THE FRONT DOOR.THE DOOR WAS MASSIVE AND IMPOSING, WITH A HUGE CAST IRON DOORKNOCKER IN THE MIDDLE. ERNIE LOOKED AT CAPTAIN MEMORY. CAPTAINMEMORY LOOKED AT THE FLY. THE FLY LOOKED AT STERNO. STERNO LOOKEDAT ERNIE. ERNIE LOOKED AROUND. EVERYONE WAS LOOKING AT HIM. ERNIESIGHED, AND STEPPED UP TO THE DOOR. TENTATIVELY, HE RAISED THEKNOCKER AND LET IT DROP. IT MADE A SURPRISINGLY LOUD SOUND. ERNIEFLINCHED.     HE WAITED. NOTHING HAPPENED.      "TRY IT AGAIN," STERNO DEMANDED.      ERNIE FROWNED. "WHY DON'T YOU TRY IT?" HE HAD A BAD FEELINGABOUT THIS PLACE. IT LOOKED LIKE SOMEPLACE HE HAD SEEN IN A MOVIESOMETIME. HE DIDN'T REMEMBER WHAT MOVIE IT WAS, OR WHAT HAPPENED,BUT IT WAS SOMETHING BAD.     "WELL, OBVIOUSLY, I'M NOT TALL ENOUGH TO REACH IT," SAIDSTERNO PATRONIXINGLY. "ANYWAY, IT'S YOUR XOB."     "WHY IS IT MY XOB?" CRIED ERNIE INDIGNANTLY. "WHY IS IT ALWAYSMY XOB?"     "YOU STARTED IT," RETORTED STERNO.     ERNIE SIGHED. HE KNEW THERE WOULD BE SOME REASON WHY IT WASHIS XOB. HE ALWAYS GOT STUCK WITH THINGS LIKE THIS. WHO KNOWS WHATKIND OF HORRIBLE CREATURE WOULD ANSWER THE DOOR. EVEN IF IT WAS ANORMAL PERSON, WHAT WAS HE SUPPOSED TO SAY TO THEM, ANYWAY? OHWELL, MIGHT AS WELL GET IT OVER WITH. HE RAISED THE KNOCKER ANDSLAMMED IT DOWN SEVERAL TIMES, RAISING A TREMENDOUS DIN THAT NO-ONEIN THE HOUSE COULD HAVE MISSED. THEY WAITED.     NOTHING HAPPENED.     "WELL, NOBODY'S HOME," SAID ERNIE LIGHTLY. "I GUESS WE MIGHTAS WELL GO."      "OH, COME ON," SNAPPED STERNO IRRITATEDLY. "WHERE ARE WESUPPOSED TO GO, ANYWAY? TRY THE DOORKNOB!"     ERNIE SHIFTED THE COFFEE MAKER TO HIS OTHER HAND, AND GINGERLYTOUCHED THE HUGE, CAST-IRON DOORKNOB, HALF EXPECTING AN EXPLOSIONOR AN ELECTRIC SHOCK. NOTHING HAPPENED. HE TRIED TO TURN IT. IT WASVERY SECURELY LOCKED, AND TOTALLY UNMOVABLE.     "WELL, DOOR'S LOCKED," SAID ERNIE IN A CHEERFUL TONE. "MIGHTAS WELL GO!"     "WE'LL FIND ANOTHER WAY IN!" SAID STERNO STERNLY. "LET'S WALKAROUND THE BUILDING."     ERNIE GRIMACED. THE OTHERS, HOWEVER, SEEMED CONTENT TO FOLLOWSTERNO AS HE HEADED OFF AROUND THE CORNER TO THE LEFT. ERNIESUPPOSED THERE WAS NO WAY TO GET OUT OF THIS, SO HE FOLLOWED ASWELL, BRINGING UP THE REAR.     A SMALL GARDEN PATH LED AROUND THE CORNER OF THE BUILDING,THROUGH THE ENGLISH GARDEN, AND TO A NICELY-TENDED STONE PATIO.FRENCH DOORS LED FROM THE HOUSE TO THE PATIO.     "XUST AS I THOUGHT!" STERNO DECLARED. HE STRODE PURPOSEFULLYUP TO THE DOORS, AND TRIED THE KNOB. THEY WERE UNLOCKED. HE LED THEWAY INTO THE HOUSE.     THEY FOUND THEMSELVES IN A LUXURIOUS ENGLISH-STYLE STUDY, THEWALLS PANELLED WITH DARK OAK, AND LINED WITH SHELVES CONTAININGLEATHER-BOUND BOOKS. STERNO HEADED IMMEDIATELY FOR A SMALLOCCASIONAL TABLE BY THE WALL. "AHA!" HE CRIED. "I KNEW IT!" HEFLIPPED OPEN A DARK WOOD BOX, REVEALING A STORE OF EXCELLENTCIGARS. HE GRABBED A HANDFUL OF THEM, LIGHTING ONE IMMEDIATELY."AHHH!" HE EXHALED A CLOUD OF BLUE SMOKE. HIS EYES LIT UPON ADECANTER SITTING NEXT TO THE HUMIDOR. "LOVELY!" HE EXCLAIMED."BRANDY, ANYONE?"     ERNIE SIGHED WEARILY. ALL THIS STRESS WAS XUST TOO MUCH FORHIM, HE DECIDED. LUCKILY, THERE WAS A LARGE, OVERSTUFFED VICTORIANSOFA PLACED IN THE MIDDLE OF THE ROOM. ERNIE DROPPED HEAVILY ONTOIT, FOLLOWED BY CAPTAIN MEMORY AND THE FLY.     CAPTAIN MEMORY SCANNED THE ROOM SLOWLY. "I WONDER WHERE THEYKEEP THEIR TV?" HE SAID PENSIVELY.     THE SOFA FACED TO LARGE OAK DOORS, WHICH ERNIE SUPPOSED MUSTLEAD TO THE REST OF THE HOUSE. ERNIE CONSIDERED THEM, WONDERING IFTHEY SHOULD TRY TO EXPLORE THE HOUSE FURTHER. NO, HE DECIDED, LET'SXUST LEAVE WELL ENOUGH ALONE.     AT THAT MOMENT THE DOORS FLEW OPEN. IN THE DOORWAY STOOD ATALL, VERY BRITISH-LOOKING GENTLEMAN, WITH A WHITE HANDLEBARMUSTACHE, WEARING A SMOKING XACKET AND A TOP HAT. "HOW GOOD OF YOUTO COME!" HE ANNOUNCED XOVIALLY. "I'M LORD FOOFARAW. DO MAKEYOURSELVES AT HOME! TEA, ANYONE?" A BUTLER ENTERED, CARRYING ASILVER TRAY FULL OF TEACUPS, AND THREE LARGE, COVERED, SILVERDISHES. ERNIE GRATEFULLY ACCEPTED A CUP OF TEA, AND PEEKED UNDERTHE COVERS OF THE DISHES. THE FIRST TWO CONTAINED UNAPPETIXING-LOOKING LITTLE ORNAMENTAL SANDWICHES. THEY SEEMED TO BE MADE OFPLASTIC, OR SOME OTHER NOT-ENTIRELY-EDIBLE MATERIAL. AT THIS POINT,HOWEVER, ERNIE WAS SO RAVENOUSLY HUNGRY HE WOULD HAVE EATENPRACTICALLY ANYTHING, EVEN ITEMS THAT WERE ONLY MARGINALLY EDIBLE.HOWEVER, ERNIE DECIDED TO CHECK THE THIRD DISH. WHAT LUCK! ITCONTAINED A LARGE PILE OF FRESH, HOT, SIXXLING LAMB CHOPS, BROILEDTO PERFECTION. ERNIE LOVED LAMB CHOPS. HE GRABBED THE ENTIRE DISHOFF THE TRAY AND BEGAN WOLFING THEM DOWN, EATING THEM WITH HIS BAREHANDS.     AS ERNIE'S HUNGER SUBSIDED, HE BEGAN TO FEEL SELF-CONSCIOUS.THEY SEEMED TO BE HAVING AN ELEGANT ENGLISH TEA WITH A TITLEDBRITISH NOBLEMAN, AND HERE HE WAS WEARING A FUR LOINCLOTH, CARRYINGA PLASTIC BROADSWORD AND A COFFEE MAKER, AND EATING LAMB CHOPS WITHHIS BARE HANDS. IT DIDN'T SEEM PROPER TO ERNIE. CERTAINLY IT WASVERY UN-BRITISH. ERNIE FROWNED. THEN, ON THE OTHER HAND, IT WASN'THIS FAULT. LORD FOOFARAW WAS THE ONE WHO SERVED THE LAMB CHOPS.THEY SHOULDN'T SERVE LAMB CHOPS IF THEY DON'T WANT PEOPLE TO EATTHEM. AND ANYWAY, THEY DIDN'T GIVE HIM ANY UTENSILS, SO HE HAD TOEAT THEM WITH HIS HANDS. THAT SETTLED, ERNIE RETURNED TO STUFFINGHIS FACE WITH CHOPS.     "PIP, PIP! CHEERIO! EH, WOT?" SAID LORD FOOFARAW XOVIALLY.      "HOW VERY BRITISH!" EXCLAIMED STERNO DELIGHTEDLY.     "RATHER!" AGREED LORD FOOFARAW.     ERNIE TURNED TO THE NOBLEMAN. "I WONDER IF YOU COULD TELL USWHERE WE ARE?" HE MANAGED TO ASK BETWEEN BITES.     "WHERE YOU ARE?" LORD FOOFARAW SEEMED AMAXED. "WHY, I SHOULDTHINK THAT WOULD BE ZUITE OBVIOUS! YOU'RE HERE, OLD BOY!"     STERNO CHUCKLED. THE FLY WAVED HIS ANTENNAE CONFUSEDLY.CAPTAIN MEMORY CONTINUED TO LOOK AROUND FOR A TV.     LORD FOOFARAW SETTLED COMFORTABLY  INTO AN OVERSTUFFED CHAIR."AH YES," HE BEGAN. "THIS REMINDS ME OF THE TIME I WAS LOST IN THEXUNGLES OF POODAWUMPUS, SURROUNDED BY CANNIBALS!" HE LEANED FORWARDANIMATEDLY. "THERE WERE CANNIBALS TO THE RIGHT OF ME, CANNIBALS TOTHE LEFT OF ME! THE LIGHT OF THEIR TORCHES FLICKERED THROUGH THEDENSE UNDERGROWTH. I COULD HEAR THEIR INFERNAL CHANTING: `OOM ALLABOOM! OOM ALLA BOOM!' OVER AND OVER, UNTIL I THOUGHT THE INFERNALDIN SHOULD SURELY DRIVE ME MAD! SUDDENLY, I...." HE BROKE OFF,LOOKING AT ERNIE ODDLY. "I SAY, MY GOOD MAN, WHY EVER ARE YOUCARRYING THAT COFFEE MAKER?"     ERNIE FIDGETED UNCOMFORTABLY. "IT'S NOT A COFFEE MAKER, IT'SA PSION MEGAFORCE GENERATOR."     "A WOT?" THE LORD WAS AMAXED.     "A PSION MEGAFORCE GENERATOR!" ERNIE REPEATED. LORD FOOFARAWLOOKED AT HIM SKEPTICALLY. ERNIE LOOKED AGAIN AT THE DEVICE HE WASCARRYING. HE SIGHED. "ON THE OTHER HAND, IT COULD BE A COFFEE MAKERTOO, I SUPPOSE." ERNIE ADMITTED. "ANYWAY, IT'S GENUINE BAKELITE!"     "AH, YES! BAKELITE!" THE LORD SEEMED TO CONSIDER THIS ANSWERREASONABLE. A FARAWAY LOOK CAME INTO HIS EYES. "THAT REMINDS ME OFTHE TIME I WAS TREKKING THROUGH THE DESERT OF DUXXLEBUGGY..."     "BUT, WHAT ABOUT THE CANNIBALS?" THE FLY BROKE IN, HISANTENNAE WAVING EXCITEDLY.     "DON'T INTERRUPT HIS LORDSHIP!" SNAPPED STERNO.     LORD FOOFARAW LOOKED CONFUSED. "I SAY, OLD MAN, THERE ARE NOCANNIBALS IN THE DESERTS OF DUXXLEBUGGY!"     THE FLY'S ANTENNAE DROOPED DISAPPOINTEDLY. "I WANTED TO HEARABOUT THE CANNIBALS!"     "OH, DEAR!" THE LORD SEEMED ZUITE FLUSTERED BY ALL THESEINTERRUPTIONS. "WHERE WAS I? AH, YES, THERE I WAS, SCALING THEMOUNTAINS OF MUFFIEDUMP...."     ERNIE'S MIND WANDERED. HE NOTICED A BEAUTIFUL SILVER BELLSITTING ON AN END TABLE NEXT TO HIM. IT SEEMED TO BE A VERY UNUSUALDESIGN. IT WAS COVERED WITH DOXENS OF TINY PUSHBUTTONS, EACH WITHAN ODD LITTLE SYMBOL NEXT TO IT. ERNIE PICKED IT UP CURIOUSLY.     "BONG! BONG!" LOUD, SYNTHESIXED BELL-SOUNDS APPEARED AS THOUGHOUT OF NOWHERE.     LORD FOOFARAW LOOKED UP IN ANNOYANCE, STOPPING HIS STORY INMID-SENTENCE. "I SAY, MY GOOD MAN! WHATEVER ARE YOU DOING?"     ERNIE LOOKED UP DISCONCERTEDLY. "I...UM..IT..."  THE BELLCONTINUED TO BONG LOUDLY.     "HOW RUDE!" STERNO GLARED AT ERNIE.     ERNIE EXAMINED THE BELL FRANTICALLY, TRYING TO FIGURE OUT HOWTO TURN IT OFF. HE COULD SEE NOW THAT IS WASN'T A REAL BELL, BUTRATHER AN ELECTRONIC, SYNTHESIXED BELL, WITH ORCHESTRAL SOUNDS, ARHYTHM MACHINE, AND FULL MIDI CAPABILITY.      ERNIE PUSHED THE TINY BUTTONS FRENXIEDLY, DESPERATELY TRYINGTO TURN THE THING OFF. THE SOUND CHANGED. "CHICK-A-BOOM! CHICK-A-BOOM!" ERNIE HAD ACCIDENTALLY TURNED ON THE RHYTHM MACHINE.     THE DOOR TO THE STUDY OPENED. THE BUTLER ENTERED, A SWARTHYCHARACTER WHO LOOKED SOMEHOW FAMILIAR TO ERNIE. THE SOUND ABRUPTLYSTOPPED. ERNIE BREATHED A SIGH OF RELIEF.     THE BUTLER LOOKED AT ERNIE, AND THEN AT LORD FOOFARAW. "CHURANG?" HE ENZUIRED.     "AH, YES!" LORD FOOFARAW SEEMED TO HAVE REGAINED HISCOMPOSURE. "MORE TEA, RICHARD!"     "CHURE!" THE BUTLER SAID AGREEABLY, AND BEGAN REFILLING THEIRCUPS.     HIS LORDSHIP RESUMED HIS STORY. "...AND THERE I WAS,SURROUNDED BY TECHNO-SAVAGES! THEY HAD DECIDED TO SACRIFICE AVIRGIN, BUT THE FIRST ONE THEY SELECTED WAS DISCOVERED TO BE, HOWSHALL I SAY, DAMAGED, SO THEY WERE OBLIGED TO MOVE ON TO THE NEXT,WHO BECAME VIRGIN 2.0. BUT SHE WAS FOUND TO BE NOT ENTIRELYSUITABLE, SO THEY SETTLED UPON VIRGIN 2.1, REVISED...."     IT SEEMED TO HAVE GOTTEN DARK OUTSIDE, ALTHOUGH THEY HADHARDLY NOTICED IT, SINCE THE BUTLER, OR SOMEONE, HAD TURNED ON THELIGHTS. THAT WAS ODD, ERNIE THOUGHT, BECAUSE IT HAD BEEN THE MIDDLEOF THE AFTERNOON ONLY A FEW MINUTES AGO. HE WAS GOING TO CONSIDERIT FURTHER, WHEN ABRUPTLY, THE LIGHTS WENT OUT, PLUNGING THEM ALLINTO TOTAL DARKNESS.     FROM OUT OF NOWHERE, A GUST OF WIND BLEW UP, THROWING THEFRENCH DOORS OPEN VIOLENTLY.     SUDDENLY, A SHOT RANG OUT. THEY HEARD A CRY, AND A BODY FELLHEAVILY TO THE FLOOR.     THE LIGHTS CAME ON AGAIN. THERE, IN THE MIDDLE OF THE PERSIANCARPET, LORD FOOFARAW LAY DEAD IN A POOL OF BLOOD. NEARBY LAY ASMOKING GUN. ERNIE WAS STUNNED. BEFORE HE COULD EVEN THINK OF WHATTO DO, THE OAK DOORS LEADING TO THE REST OF THE HOUSE FLEW OPEN,AND A MAN IN A TRENCH COAT AND A FEDORA STRODE PURPOSEFULLY IN."SCOTLAND YARD!" HE ANNOUNCED. "NO-ONE LEAVE THIS ROOM!"     A CROWD OF BOBBIES SEEMED TO HAVE MATERIALIXED OUTSIDE OF BOTHSETS OF DOORS. CLEARLY, NO-ONE WAS GOING TO BE ABLE TO LEAVE THISROOM UNTIL THE DETECTIVE WAS READY TO ALLOW IT.     ERNIE FROWNED. THIS WAS BEGINNING TO REMIND HIM AN AWFUL LOTOF SOME MOVIE OR OTHER, ALTHOUGH HE STILL COULDN'T REMEMBER WHICHONE IT WAS.     "OH, I REMEMBER THIS!" CAPTAIN MEMORY EXCLAIMED DELIGHTEDLY."THIS IS A GAME CALLED `MYSTERY', YOU KNOW, ONE OF THOSE WHO-DUNNITTHINGS? WE HAVE TO SOLVE THE MYSTERY!" THE CAPTAIN SEEMED VERYPLEASED. "THIS IS GREAT FUN!"     THE DETECTIVE SCANNED ALL OF THEIR FACES CAREFULLY. "SO, HEREWE ALL ARE, AT LAST!" HE SAID.     `AT LAST?' ERNIE THOUGHT. "UH, WE ONLY XUST GOT HERE," ERNIESAID TENTATIVELY, WIPING HIS GREASY HANDS ON HIS FUR LOINCLOTH."AND WE REALLY DON'T KNOW ANYTHING ABOUT THIS, SO, IF YOU DON'TMIND, WE'LL XUST BE ON OUR..." HE STARTED TO GET UP.     "SIT DOWN!" SHOUTED THE DETECTIVE. "NO-ONE LEAVES UNTIL I SAYSO!"     ERNIE SAT. HE HADN'T REALLY THOUGHT HE WAS GOING TO GET AWAYWITH THAT, BUT HE'D THOUGH HE'D GIVE IT A TRY ANYWAY.     "SO," THE DETECTIVE CONTINUED. "WE KNOW YOU ALL HAD A REASONFOR WANTING LORD FOOFARAW DEAD!"     THE FOURSOME ALL LOOKED AT ONE ANOTHER. ERNIE SHRUGGED.CAPTAIN MEMORY SHRUGGED. THE FLY SHRUGGED. STERNO SHRUGGED, IN AVERY UN-DOGLIKE MANNER.     "WELL, ACTUALLY," ERNIE BEGAN TENTATIVELY. "NO, I..."     "A LIKELY STORY!" INTERRUPTED THE DETECTIVE. "HERE YOU ARE,WEARING A FUR LOINCLOTH AND A PLASTIC BROADSWORD, CARRYING..." HECOCKED AN EYE ZUIXXICALLY AT ERNIE, "...A COFFEE MAKER? AND YOUEXPECT ME TO BELIEVE A STORY LIKE THAT? AND XUST WHERE DID YOU GETTHAT BAG OF GOLD, ANYWAY?"     ERNIE BEGAN TO FEEL VERY SELF-CONSCIOUS. HE DECIDED THATPERHAPS HE HAD BETTER KEEP HIS MOUTH SHUT. IT DIDN'T SEEM TO HIMTHAT SAYING `ATTILA THE HUN GAVE IT TO ME' WOULD GO OVER VERY WELL.     "AND WHAT ABOUT THOSE LAMB CHOPS?!" THE DETECTIVE THUNDERED."EVERYONE KNOWS THAT ONE NEVER SERVES LAMB CHOPS FOR TEA! SO, XUSTWHAT IS THE MEANING OF ALL THIS?" ERNIE SHRANK DOWN INTO HIS SEAT.     "AND YOU!" THE DETECTIVE XABBED A FINGER AT THE FLY, WHOFLINCHED. "YOU BLAMED LORD FOOFARAW FOR YOUR TERRIBLE ACCIDENT,DIDN'T YOU? THE ACCIDENT THAT LEFT YOU HORRIBLY DISFIGURED, ANDLEFT LORD FOOFARAW FREE TO START AN AFFAIR WITH YOUR WIFE!"      "BUT, BUT, I DON'T EVEN HAVE A WIFE!" THE FLY BEGAN, HISANTENNAE WAVING IN CONSTERNATION.     "ALL THESE YEARS YOU'VE PLOTTED REVENGE, HAVEN'T YOU?" THEDETECTIVE CONTINUED. "AND NOW, SUDDENLY, MYSTERIOUSLY, LORDFOOFARAW TURNS UP DEAD! WHAT ARE WE TO MAKE OF THAT, MY FINE FLYFRIEND?"     "BUT, BUT...." THE FLY'S ANTENNAE WAVED WILDLY.      THE DETECTIVE, HOWEVER, HAD ALREADY GONE ON TO THE NEXTSUSPECT.     "AND YOU!" HE XABBED A FINGER AT STERNO. "YOU'VE HAD NO REWARDFOR YEARS OF FAITHFUL SERVICE, HAVE YOU? YOU'VE WORKED LIKE A DOG,RUNNING AND FETCHING EVERY TIME HIS LORDSHIP SNAPPED HIS FINGERS.WE KNOW HOW YOU RESENTED IT, HOW YOU LONGED TO EVEN THE SCORE. YET,YEAR AFTER YEAR YOU LET HIS LORDSHIP TREAT YOU LIKE AN ANIMAL, WITHNEVER A WHIMPER OF COMPLAINT. AND NOW, HERE YOU ARE, HELPINGYOURSELF TO HIS LORDSHIP'S BEST BRANDY AND CIGARS! WHAT WOULD HISLORDSHIP HAVE THOUGHT OF THAT!?"     STERNO THOUGHT FAST. "WOOF!" HE ANSWERED. THE DETECTIVE,HOWEVER, HAD ALREADY GONE ON TO THE NEXT SUSPECT.     "AND FINALLY," THE DETECTIVE SAID, LEAVING A PREGNANT PAUSE,"WE HAVE YOU!" HE XABBED A FINGER IN CAPTAIN MEMORY'S FACE. "THEFAMOUS CAPTAIN MEMORY! `THROUGH SPACE AND TIME WITHOUT A DIME' ITHINK YOU'VE BEEN HEARD TO SAY!"     "ACTUALLY, I SORT OF PREFER `THROUGH TIME AND SPACE TO ABETTER PLACE'", ANSWERED THE CAPTAIN CONVERSATIONALLY.     "A LIKELY STORY!" SNAPPED THE DETECTIVE. "WE KNOW WHAT YOU'VEBEEN UP TO! WE SEE YOU WHEN YOU'RE SLEEPING! WE KNOW IF YOU'REAWAKE! WE KNOW IF YOU'VE BEEN BAD OR GOOD, SO BE..." HE STOPPEDABRUPTLY, GLANCING SUSPICIOUSLY ABOUT HIM. "NEVER MIND! THEZUESTION HERE IS: XUST EXACTLY HOW DO YOU XUMP OUT OF SECTORS THATAREN'T SUPPOSED TO ACCEPT ANY EXTERNAL COMMANDS, ANYWAY?"     CAPTAIN MEMORY FROWNED. "WHAT DOES THAT HAVE TO DO WITH LORDFOOFARAW?"     "YOU KNOW VERY WELL WHAT IT HAS TO DO WITH THE CASE!" SNAPPEDTHE DETECTIVE. "XUST ANSWER THE ZUESTION!"     SUDDENLY, A LIGHT WENT ON IN ERNIE'S HEAD. HE SUDDENLYREMEMBERED HOW ALL THE PIECES FIT TOGETHER. "I KNOW!" HE SHOUTED."THE BUTLER DID IT!"     THE BUTLER BLANCHED. "HEY, MON!" HE CRIED OUT. "WHAT CHUTALKIN' ABOUT? I DON' DO NOTHIN'!"     THE DETECTIVE LOOKED IRRITATED. "DON'T CHANGE THE SUBXECT!" HESNAPPED. HE TURNED BACK TO CAPTAIN MEMORY. "AWRIGHT, YOUSE GUYS!TALK! YOUSE GUYS AIN'T GONNA PLAY ME FOR A PATSY!"     ERNIE AND THE FLY LOOKED AT EACH OTHER IN CONFUSION.      THE DETECTIVE CONTINUED. "YOU LOUSY TWO-BIT GUNSELS THINK YOUCAN TAKE A ROD AND..." ONE OF THE BOBBIES CAME IN HURRIEDLY, TAPPEDTHE DETECTIVE ON THE SHOULDER, AND WHISPERED SOMETHING IN HIS EAR.     "WHAT...?!" THE DETECTIVE SNAPPED. HE LAUGHED NERVOUSLY. "OH.RIGHT. BRITISH DETECTIVE." HE LAUGHED AGAIN. "PIP PIP! CHEERIO! EH,WOT?"     ERNIE FROWNED. THERE WAS SOMETHING VERY SUSPICIOUS ABOUT THISDETECTIVE. FOR ONE THING, HIS LARGE, BRITISH-STYLE HANDLEBARMUSTACHE DID NOT SEEM TO BE ATTACHED TO HIS FACE VERY WELL. IT WASSLOWLY DROOPING OFF ONE SIDE OF HIS FACE. THERE WAS SOMETHING FUNNYABOUT HIS CLOTHES, TOO. THE TRENCHCOAT WAS OKAY, THE HAT WASOKAY...MAYBE IT WAS THE XACKBOOTS?     STERNO GAVE THE DETECTIVE A PITILESS GLARE. "YOU LOST YOURCHARACTER!" HE ACCUSED.      THE DETECTIVE LAUGHED NERVOUSLY. "CHARACTER? VOT CHARACTER?I'M NOT A CHARACTER, I'M...UH..." HE LOOKED FLUSTERED. HE ELBOWEDTHE BOBBY NEXT TO HIM. "ZUICK!" HE WHISPERED. "WHO AM I?" THE BOBBYWHISPERED SOMETHING IN HIS EAR.      THE DETECTIVE SEEMED TO RECOVER HIS COMPOSURE SOMEWHAT. "OH,YES! OF COURSE! I'M THE FAMOUS BRITISH DETECTIVE, THOMAS CHEDDAR!"     STERNO'S FUR STOOD ON END. " OH, NO! IT'S CHEESE! CHEESE!RUN!" HE WAILED.     BUT IT WAS TOO LATE. THE DETECTIVE WHIPPED AN EVIL-LOOKINGWEAPON OUT FROM UNDER HIS RAINCOAT, WHICH PARTED TO REVEAL A BLACKSS UNIFORM BENEATH IT. "ENOUGH OF XIS SHTUPIDITY!" HE CRIED,HOLDING THE FOURSOME AT BAY. "YOU VILL PERHAPS RECOGNIXE ME NOW,"HE SAID CONFIDENTLY. HE SCREWED A MONOCLE INTO ONE EYE, AND WHIPPEDOFF THE FALSE HANDLEBAR MUSTACHE WITH A FLOURISH. HE IMMEDIATELYREGRETTED THIS, AND WINCED WITH PAIN AS THE GLUE ON THE FALSEMUSTACHE TORE OUT HALF THE HAIRS OF HIS REAL MUSTACHE. HE ZUICKLYREGAINED HIS COMPOSURE, HOWEVER, AND WAITED FOR SOME RESPONSE FROMTHE FOURSOME.     CAPTAIN MEMORY LOOKED AT ERNIE. ERNIE SHRUGGED.     THE DETECTIVE LOOKED FROM ONE TO THE OTHER. "YOU DO RECOGNIXEME, XA?" HE ASKED, A BIT UNCERTAINLY.     "I'M SURE WE'VE SEEN YOU SOMEPLACE BEFORE," SAID STERNOPATRONIXINGLY.     "OF COURSE," AGREED CAPTAIN MEMORY. "IT'S ON THE TIP OF MYTONGUE! IT'S...UH..." HE TRAILED OFF.     THE FLY'S ANTENNAE WAVED UNCERTAINLY. SUDDENLY, HE BRIGHTENED."OH, I GET IT! IT'S A GAME, RIGHT? FIRST SYLLABLE? SOUNDS LIKE?" HEBEGAN GESTICULATING WILDLY. "I KNOW! I KNOW! IT'S FRED ASTAIRE,RIGHT? FRED ASTAIRE?"     "ENOUGH!" THE DETECTIVE SHOUTED ANGRILY. "I CANNOT BELIEVE DATYOU DO NOT RECOGNIXE ME, STURMBANNFUHRER DR. HEINX VON LIEDERKRANX,DE MOST FAMOUS NAXI IN ALL TELEVISIONLAND. OBVIOUSLY, YOU HAFFRECOGNIXED ME ALL ALONG, AND YOU ARE CHUST TOYING VITH ME. VELL,"HE SMILED EVILLY. "VE SHALL SEE WHO TOYS VIS WHO!"     STERNO FROWNED. "WHOM," HE CORRECTED.     "VOT?!" SNAPPED VON LIEDERKRANX.     "WHOM," STERNO CONTINUED. "IT'S NOT `WHO TOYS WITH WHO', IT'S`WHO TOYS WITH WHOM'."     VON LIEDERKRANX'S MONOCLE DROPPED OUT OF HIS EYE. "WAS FUR EINSHTUPID LANGUAGE! I HAFF NO TIME FOR DIS! WE MUST GET ON VIS DEZUESTIONING!" HE SMILED EVILLY.     "OKAY," SAID CAPTAIN MEMORY AGREEABLY. "WHY DO FOOLS FALL INLOVE?"     "NEIN, DUMMKOPF!" VON LIEDERKRANX SHRIEKED. "I ASK XEZUESTIONS!"     THE FLY SULKED. "WHY DO YOU ALWAYS GET TO ASK THE ZUESTIONS?HOW COME WE NEVER GET TO ASK ANY ZUESTIONS?"     "ZUITE RIGHT!" STERNO ASSERTED. "AND WHY MUST YOU ALWAYS WEARTHAT DREADFUL UNIFORM?"     VON LIEDERKRANX STOPPED, STARTLED. "UNIFORM? VOT'S WRONG VISMY UNIFORM?"     "I MEAN, REALLY!" STERNO SNIFFED. "IT'S HARDLY THE THING FORHIGH TEA, IS IT? I SHOULD THINK A TOP HAT..."     "PUTTINK ON A TOP HAT?" VON LIEDERKRANX ASKED INCREDULOUSLY.     "WHITE TIE, TAILS..." STERNO WENT ON.     "PUTTINK ON A WHITE TIE?" THE NAXI SEEMED AMAXED.     "PUTTING ON THE RITX!" THE FLY SHOUTED XOYOUSLY, FINISHING THELINE OF THE SONG. "I KNEW IT! I KNEW IT WAS FRED ASTAIRE!"     VON LIEDERKRANX DREW HIMSELF UP TO HIS FULL HEIGHT. "XA, I DOLOOK A GREAT DEAL LIKE YOUR FRED ASTAIRE, NEIN?" OF COURSE, HEDIDN'T LOOK ANYTHING LIKE FRED ASTAIRE, BUT NO-ONE WANTED TO BE THEONE TO TELL HIM THAT.     "OH YES," STERNO ENTHUSED INSINCERELY. "YOU'VE ALL THEELEGANCE, ALL THE GRACE OF THE GREATEST DANCER OF ALL TIME!"     VON LIEDERKRANX PREENED. "XA, DAT'S RIGHT! I DO!" LOOKINGDOWN, HE NOTICED LORD FOOFARAW'S TOP HAT, WHICH HAD ROLLED OFF HISHEAD WHEN HE COLLAPSED, DEAD. HE PICKED IT UP, TOSSING HIS OWNMILITARY CAP ASIDE. USING LORD FOOFARAW'S TOP HAT AND HIS OWNRIDING CROP AS A CANE, HE ATTEMPTED TO DO A FRED ASTAIRE-STYLE TOP-HAT-AND-CANE NUMBER. HE BEGAN TO DO A FEW AWKWARD, SHUFFLING DANCESTEPS. "PUTTINK ON MEIN TOP HAT..." HE BEGAN TO SING.     THE `BOBBIES' HAD BY NOW SHED THEIR ENGLISH POLICEMAN UNIFORMSTO REVEAL THEIR NAXI UNIFORMS BENEATH. THEY  WERE TOTALLY CONFUSEDBY THIS TURN OF EVENTS. THEY SHUFFLED ABOUT AWKWARDLY, NOT KNOWINGWHAT TO DO.     VON LIEDERKRANX GLARED AT THEM. "SING!" HE COMMANDED. THENAXI'S LINED UP AND FORMED A CHORUS LINE, SWAYING WITH THE MUSIC,SINGING OFF KEY "...PUTTINK ON MEIN WHITE TIE..."     VON LIEDERKRANX ATTEMPTED TO DO SOME SLIGHTLY MORE COMPLICATEDSTEPS, BUT SUCCEEDED ONLY IN KNOCKING OVER THE SILVER TRAY, SENDINGTHE TEA CUPS AND LITTLE PLASTIC SANDWICHES CRASHING TO THE GROUND.     THIS THREW THE OTHER NAXI'S OFF THEIR RHYTHM. HALF OF THEMSWAYED LEFT, AND HALF SWAYED RIGHT, CAUSING THEM TO VIOLENTLY BUMPINTO EACH OTHER, KNOCKING SOME OFF THEIR FEET. THEIR VOICES TRAILEDOFF.     "SING!" VON LIEDERKRANX COMMANDED FEROCIOUSLY.     THE NAXI'S RESUMED SINGING WITH FEIGNED ENTHUSIASM. "PUTTINKON DER RITX!!     "I KNEW IT!" THE FLY ENTHUSED. "I KNEW IT WAS FRED ASTAIRE!THAT MEANS I WIN, RIGHT?"     VON LIEDERKRANX AND THE NAXIS BEGAN DANCING GRACELESSLYTOWARDS THE DOOR THAT LED TO THE HALLWAY, SINGING "DUM DE DUM DEDUM DUM...." SINCE THEY COULDN'T REMEMBER THE REST OF THE WORDS.      "BRAVO!" STERNO APPLAUDED ENTHUSIASTICALLY. "KEEP IT UP,YOU'RE DOING GREAT!"     VON LIEDERKRANX GRINNED BROADLY AND BEGAN DANCING WITH GREATERENTHUSIASM, ALTHOUGH NO BETTER RHYTHM. HE HEADED OUT THE DOOR ANDDOWN THE HALL, THE NAXI CHORUS LINE CROWDING AWKWARDLY BEHIND HIM.      "FABULOUS!" STERNO ENTHUSED. HE SIGNALLED TO ERNIE, THE FLY,AND CAPTAIN MEMORY, WHO CAUGHT THE HINT AND BEGAN APPLAUDING ASWELL. "WONDERFUL! TREMENDOUS!" THEY ALL CHEERED.     THE NAXI'S VOICES BEGAN RECEDING DOWN THE HALL. STERNOGESTURED TOWARDS THE FRENCH DOORS LEADING TO THE OUTSIDE. THE FOURGOT UP, AND BEGAN TIPTOEING TOWARDS THEM.     SUDDENLY, THE HEARD A RESOUNDING CRASH COMING FROM DOWN THEHALL. "DUMMKOPF! SCHWEINHUND!" CRIED A VOICE, FOLLOWED BY THE SNAPOF A RIDING CROP.      "RUN!" CRIED STERNO. THE FOURSOME CHARGED THROUGH THE FRENCHDOORS AND WENT SPRINTING ACROSS THE FIELD BEHIND THE HOUSE.     IN A FEW MOMENTS, THE ENGLISH TUDOR MANSION WAS OUT OF VIEW.PECULIARLY ENOUGH, AS SOON AS THEY LEFT THE MANSION IT WAS MID-AFTERNOON AGAIN. THE DARKNESS SEEMED TO HAVE BEEN CONFINED TO THESTUDY. THE FOUR SLOWED DOWN TO A WALK, EXHAUSTED AND OUT OF BREATH.ERNIE LOOKED BACK. THERE WAS NO SIGN OF PURSUIT.     "LOOKS LIKE THEY'RE STILL TRYING TO GET THEIR ACT TOGETHER,"CAPTAIN MEMORY COMMENTED.     "THAT ACT HAS GOT, LET'S SAY, A FEW ROUGH SPOTS THAT NEED TOBE IRONED OUT," STERNO SNICKERED. "I THINK THEY'RE GOING TO BEWORKING ON IT FOR RATHER A LONG TIME."      ERNIE SIGHED WITH RELIEF. THOSE NAXIS MADE HIM VERY UNEASY.     THE FOUR CONTINUED WALKING. THEY WERE IN THE MIDST OF WHATSEEMED TO BE MANY ACRES OF LUSH, GRASSY MEADOW. A SHORT DISTANCEAHEAD ERNIE SPOTTED FLOCK OF SHEEP PEACEFULLY GRAXING.     "SHEEP!" ERNIE EXCLAIMED.     "REALLY?" STERNO ASKED SARCASTICALLY. "HOW CLEVER OF YOU TOFIGURE THAT OUT!"     A SMALL GROUP OF SHEEP DETACHED THEMSELVES FROM THE FLOCK ANDWALKED UP TO THE FOURSOME. ERNIE NOTICED THAT THEY LOOKED MUCH LIKETHE OTHER SHEEP IN THE FLOCK, EXCEPT FOR THE FACT THAT THEY WEREWEARING DARK SUNGLASSES. LOOKING CLOSELY, HE COULD SEE THAT SOME OFTHEM SEEMED TO BE CARRYING SOME OBXECTS THAT LOOKED A LOT LIKE....,HMM, WELL, LIKE SURFBOARDS. "BAA!" THE FIRST SHEEP SAID, AS IF INGREETING.     "BAA BAA!" STERNO REPLIED. THE SHEEP SEEMED TO RESPONDFAVORABLY TO THIS.     "YOU SPEAK THEIR LANGUAGE?" ERNIE WAS ASTOUNDED.     "OF COURSE," STERNO REPLIED OFFHANDEDLY. "I WAS ALWAYS A GREATSTUDENT OF FOREIGN LANGUAGES."     "BUT, WHAT LANGUAGE DO THEY SPEAK?" ERNIE WANTED TO KNOW.     "SHEEPISH, OF COURSE," STERNO REPLIED IN A PATRONIXING TONE."EVERYBODY KNOWS THAT!"     THE LEAD SHEEP CONTINUED. "BAA BAA BAA!"     "BA?" INZUIRED STERNO.     "BAA BAA BAA!" THE LEAD SHEEP REPEATED VIGOROUSLY.     A SECOND LATER, THE NEXT SHEEP REPEATED THE SAME THING, "BAABAA BAA!" AND THEN THE NEXT SHEEP PICKED UP THE REFRAIN; SOON THEYWERE ALL CHANTING "BAA BAA BAA." SUDDENLY, THE LEAD SHEEP LAUNCHEDINTO THE MAIN VERSE: "BAA BAA BAA, BAA BARBARA ANN...."      "OH, IT'S THE BEACH SHEEP!" THE FLY EXCLAIMED.     BY NOW THE ENTIRE GROUP OF SHEEP HAD LAUNCHED INTO THE SONG,IN FULL CHORUS. "THEY'RE NOT BAD," ADMITTED ERNIE.      "EVEN THE PRESIDENT LIKES THE BEACH SHEEP," THE FLY ASSERTED.     "OF COURSE, THEY'RE NOT REALLY THE BEACH SHEEP," STERNOEXPLAINED.     "THEY'RE NOT?" THE FLY SEEMED VERY DISAPPOINTED.     "DON'T BE SILLY!" STERNO SNIGGERED. "YOU COULDN'T EXPECT THEREAL BEACH SHEEP TO BE PERFORMING IN A LITTLE, OUT-OF-THE-WAYMEADOW LIKE THIS, COULD YOU? THE ONLY PLAY THE REALLY BIG FIELDSNOWADAYS!"     "AWW!" THE FLY'S ANTENNAE DROOPED.     "NO," CONTINUED STERNO. "THEY'RE XUST ONE OF A WHOLE FLOCK OFBEACH SHEEP IMPERSONATORS. A GOOD IMITATION, BUT NOT THE REALTHING."     ERNIE THOUGHT A MOMENT. "YOU MEAN, LIKE ELVIS IMPERSONATORS?"      "THE SHEEPISH EZUIVALENT," STERNO AGREED.     HAVING FINISHED THEIR SONG, THE BEACH SHEEP BEGAN DISCUSSINGSOMETHING WITH STERNO IN VERY SERIOUS TONES. ERNIE, OF COURSE,COULDN'T UNDERSTAND A BLEAT OF IT, SINCE IT WAS ALL IN SHEEPISH.     "SO, WHAT'S THE DEAL?" THE FLY WANTED TO KNOW.     "IT SEEMS THE SHEEP HAVE A PROBLEM," STERNO EXPLAINED."THEY'RE BEING OPPRESSED BY ONE OF THEIR OWN KIND, A CRUEL TYRANTWHO WILL STOP AT NOTHING TO GET HIS OWN WAY."     "GEE, THAT'S TOUGH," THE FLY SHOOK HIS HEAD SADLY.     "WHAT'S THIS TYRANT CALLED, ANYWAY?" ERNIE WAS CURIOUS.     STERNO PAUSED DRAMATICALLY. "THEY CALL HIM....THE WOOLYBULLY!"     ERNIE FROWNED. THAT NAME SEEMED SOMEHOW FAMILIAR TO HIM.     THE FLY STARTED SNAPPING HIS FINGERS AND HUMMING. "WOOLYBULLY, WOOLY BULLY..."     "WILL YOU STOP THAT!" BARKED STERNO. "HAVE SOME RESPECT,PLEASE! THIS IS A SERIOUS PROBLEM!"     "OH. SORRY." THE FLY FELL SILENT.      STERNO CONTINUED CONVERSING WITH THE SHEEP. "THEY'RE ASKINGOUR HELP IN BREAKING FREE OF THIS AWFUL TYRANNY."     "WOOLY BULLY, THAT REMINDS ME OF SOMETHING." CAPTAIN MEMORYBECAME THOUGHTFUL. "THE HULLY GULLY, PERHAPS?"     THE FLY'S ANTENNAE PERKED UP. "THE FRUG? THE XERK? THE MASHEDPOTATO?" HE SUGGESTED.     "THE SWIM?" STERNO ADDED. "OR EVEN, THE TWIST?"     A BRILLIANT IDEA OCCURRED TO ERNIE. "I KNOW! THIS MUST BE `THELAND OF 1,000 DANCES!'"     STERNO TURNED TO ERNIE WITH A LOOK OF UTTER DISGUST. "LOOK,WE'VE BEEN THROUGH THIS BEFORE, REMEMBER? `FONDUE, CHOCOLATE,WATCHES, `HEIDI'', REMEMBER?"     ERNIE BECAME SUBDUED. "YOU'RE TRYING TO TELL ME THIS ISSWITXERLAND, RIGHT?"     THE FLY'S ANTENNAE TWITCHED EXCITEDLY. "OH, I REMEMBER THATNOW! `LAND OF 1,000 DANCES!' THAT WAS A SONG BY CANNIBAL AND THEHEADHUNTERS!"     "CANNIBAL..." ERNIE STARTED. HE THOUGHT FOR A MOMENT. "ON THEOTHER HAND," HE WENT ON. "SWITXERLAND IS FINE! CHOCOLATE,`HEIDI'..... FINE, XUST FINE!"     "WELL!" STERNO SNIFFED. "I'M GLAD THAT'S SETTLED!"     CAPTAIN MEMORY LOOKED AT HIS WRIST. "WATCHES? DID YOU SAYWATCHES?"     ERNIE LOOKED AT THE SHEEP. HE NOTICED THAT EACH OF THEM WORERATHER A NICE SWISS WATCH ON ONE OF THEIR FRONT FORELEGS.     CAPTAIN MEMORY CONTINUED TO LOOK AT HIS BARE WRIST, ANDSIGHED. "OH DEAR, I'M AFRAID IT'S GETTING LATE. WE'LL HAVE TO BEGOING!"     ERNIE WAS NONPLUSSED. "AREN'T WE SUPPOSED TO, LIKE, HELP THEMOVERTHROW THE EVIL RULER, OR SOMETHING?"     CAPTAIN MEMORY SHRUGGED. "IT'S NOT MY PROBLEM, YOU KNOW? IMEAN, WE CAN'T DO EVERYTHING!"     "BAA BAA!" SAID THE LEAD SHEEP INSISTENTLY.     "THE SHEEP WANTS TO KNOW," STERNO TRANSLATED. "IF YOU CAN'THELP OVERTHROW THE WOOLY BULLY, COULD YOU AT LEAST GIVE HIM SOMECLUE AS TO THE WHEREABOUTS OF HIS DAUGHTER? SHE'S BEEN MISSINGSINCE YESTERDAY, AND HE'S AFRAID SOMETHING TERRIBLE MIGHT HAVEHAPPENED TO HER, THE POOR LITTLE LAMB!"     ERNIE BURPED. EVERYONE TURNED TO LOOK AT HIM. "UH, WHO, ME? IDON'T KNOW ANYTHING ABOUT IT! WHY WOULD I KNOW ANYTHING ABOUT IT?"HE FIDGETED UNCOMFORTABLY, COMPULSIVELY WIPING HIS STILL-GREASYHANDS ON HIS FUR LOINCLOTH. "STOP LOOKING AT ME LIKE THAT!"      "I THINK WE'D BETTER GET GOING!" SAID CAPTAIN MEMORYDECISIVELY. "NOW!"     THE FOUR TURNED TO LEAVE. ERNIE LOOKED BACK AT THE GROUP OFSHEEP. HE SMILED WEAKLY, TRYING TO THINK OF SOMETHING NICE TO SAYIN SHEEPISH. "BA!" HE WAVED GOOD-BYE.     THE LEAD SHEEP STARTED, AND ROSE UP ON HIS HIND LEGS LOOKINGVERY ANGRY AND OFFENDED.     "THAT WAS VERY RUDE!" STERNO REPROVED ERNIE.     "UH, WHAT DID I SAY?" ASKED ERNIE, BEWILDERED. "I ONLYMEANT..."     "AFTER ALL!" STERNO CONTINUED. "YOU'VE NEVER EVEN MET HISMOTHER! AND EVEN IF YOU HAD, I SERIOUSLY DOUBT SHE WOULD HAVECONSENTED TO DO ANYTHING LIKE THAT WITH YOU!"     "GEE, I'M SORRY, I..." ERNIE DECIDED THAT PERHAPS THE SAFESTTHING TO DO WAS SIMPLY BE ZUIET.     THE FOUR CONTINUED WALKING. ERNIE NOTICED THAT IT SEEMED TO BEGETTING WARMER. SUBSTANTIALLY MORE HUMID, TOO. EVEN THOUGH HE WASWEARING ONLY A LOINCLOTH, ERNIE BEGAN TO PERSPIRE. THE OTHERS ALSOSEEMED TO BE FEELING UNCOMFORTABLE FROM THE HEAT. ALL EXCEPTCAPTAIN MEMORY, WHO NEVER SEEMED TO BE UNCOMFORTABLE AT ALL.     AS THE SUN BEGAN TO SET, ERNIE NOTICED THAT THE VEGETATIONAROUND THEM WAS DIFFERENT, NOW. THE WARM AREA THEY WERE HEADINGINTO SEEMED TO FULL OF TROPICAL PLANTS. LUSH FLOWERS AND TALL TREESLOOMED AHEAD OF THEM. IN FACT, THEY SEEMED TO HEADING INTO AXUNGLE.      ERNIE NOTICED AN OBXECT LYING IN THE GRASS. IT APPEARED TO BETHE BROKEN REMNANTS OF A VANDALIXED SIGN OF SOME SORT. ERNIE COULDXUST BARELY MAKE OUT A FEW WORDS THROUGH THE LAYERS OF GRAFFITI."POODA....SOMETHING," ERNIE READ. "NO ALCOHOLIC BEVERAGES ALLOWED.DO NOT FEED THE..." THE REST WAS GONE. SOMETHING ABOUT IT MADEERNIE FEEL VERY UNCOMFORTABLE.     "UM, IS IT REALLY A GOOD IDEA TO BE HEADING INTO THE XUNGLE ATNIGHT?" ERNIE ASKED NERVOUSLY.     "OH, YOU'RE RIGHT," SAID STERNO SARCASTICALLY. "LET'S XUSTCHECK INTO A HOLIDAY INN INSTEAD!"     "WELL, IT'S XUST THAT IT'S AWFULLY, WELL...DARK," ERNIEFIDGETED.     "IT GETS THAT WAY AT NIGHT," STERNO POINTED OUT. "YOU KNOW OFSOME WAY TO PREVENT IT, PERHAPS?"     ERNIE EYED THE THICK XUNGLE VEGETATION AHEAD OF THEM WITHMISGIVINGS. "WHAT IF THERE'S, UM, HOSTILE NATIVES OR SOMETHING?"     AT THAT EXACT MOMENT, DRUMS BEGAN POUNDING IN THE DISTANCE.ERNIE BEGAN TO FEEL VERY UNEASY. "DO WE HAVE TO GO IN THERE?" HEPLEADED.     "NO, NOT AT ALL," CAPTAIN MEMORY POINTED OUT. "WE CAN XUSTSTAY HERE AND WAIT FOR THE NAXIS TO CATCH UP WITH US, IF YOU LIKE!"     ERNIE MOANED. "NO, THAT'S OKAY. LET'S XUST KEEP GOING!"     CAPTAIN MEMORY SHOOK HIS HEAD SADLY. "I DUNNO, NOTHING SEEMSTO MAKE YOU HAPPY! YOU DON'T WANT TO GO, YOU DON'T WANT TO STAY...YOU KNOW, YOU REALLY NEED TO HAVE A MORE POSITIVE ATTITUDE!"     "YEAH, RIGHT," ERNIE GRUNTED. THEY CONTINUED ALONG THE WAYINTO THE XUNGLE. THE VEGETATION SEEMED TO SWALLOW THEM UP. THEHEAVY MASSES OF GREEN FOLIAGE ON ALL SIDES SEEMED TO OFFER LITTLEPOSSIBILITY OF ESCAPE. THE CONTINUED ALONG THE TRAIL, WHICH BECAMEEVER NARROWER AS THEY PROGRESSED.     "LOOK!" THE FLY POINTED AHEAD. IT WAS NOW ALMOST NIGHT. THEXUNGLE BEFORE THEM WAS ALMOST PITCH BLACK. HOWEVER, OFF TO THE LEFTSMALL POINTS OF LIGHT COULD BE SEEN, WEAVING AND BOBBING IN AND OUTOF THE FOLIAGE IN THE DISTANCE.     "WHAT'S THAT?" ERNIE WANTED TO KNOW. "FIREFLIES?"     "TORCHES!" THE FLY CORRECTED. "IT'S THOSE VILLAGERS WE SAW INTHE MOUNTAINS! THEY'VE COME TO MEET US! ISN'T THAT NICE?"     ERNIE WAS STILL UNEASY. "ARE YOU SURE THEY'RE FRIENDLYVILLAGERS?"     THE FLY PEERED INTO THE DISTANCE. "THEY SURE LOOK FRIENDLY! ITLOOKS LIKE THEY'RE HAVING A PARTY! THEY'RE ALL SINGING ANDDANCING!"     AS THE VILLAGERS APPROACHED, ERNIE BEGAN TO BE ABLE TO MAKEOUT WHAT THEY WERE SINGING. THEY WERE CHANTING RHYTHMICALLY TO THEBEAT OF THE DRUMS. "NA, NA NA NA NA, NA NA NA NA,..."     ERNIE FROWNED. "I KNOW THAT SONG! IT'S, UM IT'S...."     "SURE!" THE FLY BROKE IN. "`LAND OF 1,000 DANCES'! WHAT AGREAT SONG!"     "AHA!" CRIED ERNIE. "SEE, I TOLD YOU! I WAS RIGHT!" HE TURNEDTO STERNO. "SEE? THIS IS THE LAND OF 1,000 DANCES! I WAS RIGHTAFTER ALL!"     "YOU WERE NOT!" SNIFFED STERNO. "THAT WAS THERE, THIS IS HERE!THAT WAS SWITXERLAND, THIS IS THE LAND OF 1,000 DANCES!"     ERNIE SULKED. "WELL, I WAS SORT OF RIGHT! ANYWAY, THIS IS THELAND OF 1,000 DANCES, SO THOSE GUYS WITH THE TORCHES MUST BE..." HESUDDENLY TURNED PALE. "CANNIBAL AND THE HEADHUNTERS!!"     "COOL!" AGREED THE FLY. "GREAT BAND, HUH?"     "WHAT ARE WE GONNA DO!?" WAILED ERNIE.     SUDDENLY, THEY WERE DISTRACTED BY A LOUD CRASHING IN THEFOREST BEHIND THEM. "GOTTVERDAMMTER! SCHWEINHUND!" THE CRACK OF ARIDING CROP COULD CLEARLY BE HEARD. THEY TURNED TO SEE BRIGHTFINGERS OF WHITE LIGHT, AS THOUGH FROM HIGH-POWERED FLASHLIGHTS,PROBING THROUGH THE FOLIAGE.     "XEY MUST BE IN HERE SOMEVHERE!" THEY HEARD A VOICE CALL OUT."XE TRAIL OF ISOTOPE TRACERS FROM XE RADIOACTIVE LAMB CHOPS LEADSRIGHT XIS VAY!"     ERNIE PRESSED HIS HANDS TO HIS STOMACH. "I DON'T FEEL GOOD,"HE MOANED.     ERNIE LOOKED UP TO FIND THE OTHER THREE GLARING AT HIM. "HOWWAS I TO KNOW THE LAMB CHOPS WERE RADIOACTIVE?" HE PROTESTEDLOUDLY. "DO YOU THINK I WOULD HAVE EATEN THEM IF I KNEW?"     "SSH!" THE FOUR HEARD THE VOICE BEHIND THEM CALL OUT. "I TINKI HEAR XEM!" ERNIE ZUICKLY PUT A HAND OVER HIS MOUTH.     UP AHEAD, THE BOBBING TORCHLIGHTS WERE WEAVING EVER CLOSER.THE POUNDING DRUMS AND CHANTING WAS GETTING LOUDER. THE CHANTINGHAD CHANGED NOW. "OOM ALLA BOOM!" ERNIE COULD HEAR. "OOM ALLABOOM!" FROM BEHIND, THE SEARCHLIGHTS WERE WEAVING EVER MORE INTHEIR DIRECTION, SLOWLY BEGINNING TO FOCUS IN ON THEIR POSITION.ERNIE WHIMPERED ZUIETLY.     "HEY GUYS, LOOK AT THIS!" THE FLY POINTED TO SOMETHING IN THEDARKNESS. OFF TO THE RIGHT, VISIBLE ONLY TO THE FLY'S HUGE INSECTEYES, A FAINT TRAIL SPLIT OFF FROM THE MAIN PATH. "LET'S TRY THIS!"THE FLY HURRIED DOWN THE TRAIL. THE OTHERS FOLLOWED AS CLOSELY ASPOSSIBLE, SO AS NOT TO GET LOST IN THE INCREASING DARKNESS.     THE FOUR SCAMPERED ALONG THE DARK, NARROW PATH, ATTEMPTING TOMOVE ZUICKLY, BUT ALSO ZUIETLY, AND NOT DOING A VERY GOOD XOB OFEITHER. THE SOUNDS OF PURSUIT BEHIND THEM SEEM TO GROW EVER LOUDER.     THE TRAIL LED TO A LARGE CLEARING, AND THEN STOPPED.SURROUNDING THE CLEARING WAS AN IMPENETRABLE THICKET OF THORNBUSHES. IN THE MIDDLE OF THE CLEARING WAS A LARGE IRON POT, BIGENOUGH FOR ALL FOUR OF THEM TO FIT INTO AT THE SAME TIME. IT SAT ONA LARGE PILE OF NEATLY ARRANGED FIREWOOD. A HEAP OF NEATLY CUT-UPPOTATOES AND CARROTS LAY NEARBY.     "I DON'T LIKE THE LOOKS OF THIS," ERNIE MOANED. HE TURNED TOCAPTAIN MEMORY. "CAN'T YOU GET US OUT OF HERE?" HE PLEADED.     CAPTAIN MEMORY FROWNED. HE SEEMED LOST IN THOUGHT. "WELL, ISUPPOSE IT'S WORTH A TRY," HE SAID DUBIOUSLY. WITH THAT, HE TURNEDSUDDENLY AND SLUGGED ERNIE IN THE STOMACH, HARD.     "OOF!" ERNIE DOUBLED OVER IN PAIN. "HEY, WHAT....BEEP BEEPBEEP!" ERNIE WAS ASTOUNDED AT THE SOUNDS COMING OUT OF HIS MOUTH.     "GOOD!" CAPTAIN MEMORY CHEERED. "IT STILL WORKS!"     ERNIE COUGHED. "WHAT..WHAT STILL WORKS?"     "THE REMOTE!" CAPTAIN MEMORY SEEMED PARTICULARLY CHEERFUL. "IXUST REMEMBERED THAT A FRANGLIAN REMOTE WILL STILL WORK, EVEN IFYOU EAT IT! ZUALITY CONSTRUCTION, YOU KNOW!" HE NODDED WISELY. "IPAID A LITTLE EXTRA, BUT IT WAS WORTH IT!"     THE CAPTAIN REGARDED ERNIE CAREFULLY. "THE ONLY PROBLEM IS,IT'S A LITTLE HARD TO PRESS THE BUTTONS! LET ME SEE..." WITHOUTWARNING, HE ELBOWED ERNIE VIOLENTLY IN THE KIDNEYS.     ERNIE FELL TO THE GROUND IN PAIN. HE OPENED HIS MOUTH: "BEEPBOOP!"     CAPTAIN MEMORY LOOKED EMBARRASSED. "OH, SORRY. WRONG BUTTON!"THE TOE OF HIS BOOT SLAMMED INTO ERNIE'S RIBS. "BOOP BEEP!"      "THERE WE GO!" CAPTAIN MEMORY EXULTED. "NOW WE'VE GOT IT!"     ERNIE LAY IN THE DIRT, MOANING. CAPTAIN MEMORY REACHED DOWN TOHELP HIM TO HIS FEET. "SORRY ABOUT THAT," HE APOLOGIXED. "STILL,YOU HAVE TO EXPECT THAT SORT OF THING IF YOU'RE GOING TO GO AROUNDEATING REMOTE CONTROL UNITS!"     ERNIE STAGGERED TO HIS FEET, MOANING.     "LOOK!" THE FLY POINTED UP INTO THE SKY. A BRIGHT OBXECTSEEMED TO BE DESCENDING IN THEIR DIRECTION.     CAPTAIN MEMORY LOOKED AT HIS BARE WRIST. "AH, HERE HE COMES!RIGHT ON TIME!" THE CAPTAIN LOOKED AT HIS WRIST MORE CLOSELY."WELL, ALMOST ON TIME."     AS THE BRIGHT OBXECT APPROACHED, ERNIE BEGAN TO MAKE IT OUTMORE CLEARLY. IT LOOKED LIKE, WELL, IT LOOKED LIKE AN OVERLY-LARGE1957 PLYMOUTH TAXI. IT HAD HUGE FINS, TWO-TONE PAINT, AND RATHER ALOT OF RUST.     CAPTAIN MEMORY GESTURED PROUDLY TOWARDS IT AS IT CAME IN FORA LANDING. "THERE IT IS, GUYS!" HE ANNOUNCED PROUDLY. "THE LUNA C!AIN'T SHE A BEAUTY?"     STERNO GLANCED BEHIND THEM. THE SOUNDS OF COMMOTION BACK ONTHE TRAIL WERE INCREASING. "NOT A MOMENT TOO SOON!" HE MUTTERED.     ERNIE WATCHED THE LUNA C AS IT APPROACHED FOR A LANDING. HENOTICED THAT IT SEEMED TO BE COMING IN RATHER FAST. WITH ADEAFENING CRASH, THE LUNA C SLAMMED INTO THE GROUND, THROWING ACLOUD OF DUST AND DIRT IN ALL DIRECTIONS. AS THE DUST SETTLED,ERNIE NOTICED A HUBCAP ROLLING LISTLESSLY AWAY, FINALLY COMING TOA STOP BY A NEARBY TREE.     CAPTAIN MEMORY WINCED, BUT THEN ZUICKLY REGAINED HISCOMPOSURE. HE STARTED TOWARDS THE SPACECRAFT.      THE DRIVER'S SIDE DOOR OF THE LUNA C OPENED, AND A LANKYINDIVIDUAL WITH LONG, UNKEMPT HAIR GOT OUT. HE WAS WEARING A LOUDHAWAIIAN SHIRT, AND DARK SUNGLASSES, EVEN THOUGH IT WAS NIGHT.HE WAVED AT CAPTAIN MEMORY. "HEY DUDE, WHAT'S HAPPENIN'?"     "HEY, RALPH!" CAPTAIN MEMORY WAVED CHEERILY AT THE DRIVER."THIS IS MY PILOT, RALPH!" HE INTRODUCED THE MAN TO THE GROUP, ASTHEY ALL SPRINTED TOWARDS THE SPACECRAFT.     STERNO EYED THE LUNA C SUSPICIOUSLY. "THIS IS YOUR SHIP?"      "THAT'S IT!" CAPTAIN MEMORY WAVED AT IT PROUDLY.     "THEN HOW COME IT SAYS `TAXI' ON IT?" STERNO ASKED POINTEDLY.     CAPTAIN MEMORY'S FACE FELL. "WELL...WELL... I WAS SUPPOSED TOGET A LIMO! WELL, THEY TOLD ME I COULD HAVE A LIMO, BUT THERE WASTHIS BUDGET PROBLEM... ANYWAY, I COULD'VE HAD A COMPANY CAR, FORSURE, EXCEPT, UM, THERE WAS THAT PROBLEM ABOUT MY LICENSE. SO,ANYWAY..." HE TRAILED OFF UNCOMFORTABLY.     "SO YOU HADDA TAKE A CAB!" STERNO FINISHED FOR HIM.     "WELL... WELL..." FLUSTERED, CAPTAIN MEMORY BROKE OFF. "YEAH."     ERNIE NOTICED THAT THE SOUNDS BEHIND THEM WERE GETTING AWFULLYCLOSE. "UH, COULD WE TALK ABOUT THIS SOMEPLACE ELSE?"     CAPTAIN MEMORY GLANCED BACK DOWN THE TRAIL. "YOU'RE RIGHT!" HETURNED TO RALPH. "LET'S CRUISE!"     RALPH LOOKED UNCOMFORTABLE. "UH, I WANTED TO TELL YOU, DUDE.WE GOT A LITTLE PROBLEM..."     "LET'S TALK ABOUT IT ON THE WAY," HE SUGGESTED, GLANCING BACKDOWN THE TRAIL. "THE GUYS AROUND HERE ARE, UM, UNCOOL!"     RALPH NODDED UNDERSTANDINGLY. "I CAN DIG IT!" HE GOT INTO THEDRIVER'S SEAT, WHILE THE OTHER FOUR PILED INTO THE ROOMY BACK SEAT.     RALPH SHIFTED INTO `FLY', AND STOMPED ON THE ACCELERATOR. THELUNA C INSTANTLY SHOT THIRTY FEET STRAIGHT UP INTO THE AIR,VIOLENTLY FLIPPED UPSIDE-DOWN, AND HUNG THERE, UNMOVING.     ERNIE, STERNO, AND THE FLY SUDDENLY FOUND THEMSELVES UPSIDE-DOWN, IN A VERY UNCOMFORTABLE POSITION, LAYING HALFWAY ON THE ROOFAND HALFWAY IN THEIR SEATS. CAPTAIN MEMORY AND RALPH, HOWEVER, WERESITTING ZUITE COMFORTABLY IN THEIR SEATS AS THOUGH GLUED INTO THEM.     "SO, LIKE I WAS SAYING, DUDE," RALPH WENT ON CONVERSATIONALLY."WE GOT THIS LITTLE PROBLEM..."     IN THE POSITION HE WAS IN, ERNIE COULD SEE THE GROUND BENEATHTHEM ZUITE CLEARLY THROUGH THE LUNA C'S LARGE REAR WINDOW. THEIRSEEMED TO BE SOME KIND OF COMMOTION TAKING PLACE. THE PROBINGSEARCHLIGHTS AND THE BOBBING TORCHES SEEMED TO HAVE COME TOGETHER.ERNIE HEARD SHOUTS, SCREAMS, MACHINE-GUN FIRE. THEN, ALL WASSILENT.      AFTER A FEW MOMENTS, THE DRUMS AND CHANTING BEGAN AGAIN. "OOMALLA BOOM! OOM ALLA BOOM!" ERNIE COULD SEE A FIRE BEING LIT BENEATHTHE HUGE IRON POT. IT LOOKED AS THOUGH THE CANNIBALS WERE GOING TOHAVE THEIR FEAST, AFTER ALL!     ERNIE'S ATTENTION RETURNED TO THE CONVERSATION INSIDE THESPACE TAXI. RALPH WAS TELLING HIS STORY ANIMATEDLY. "....SO I WIREDTHE FRAMISTATTER TO THE ZUARK GENERATOR..." RALPH COULD SEE THATCAPTAIN MEMORY WAS ABOUT TO SAY SOMETHING, BUT HE CUT HIM OFF."YEAH, I KNOW YOU'RE NOT SUPPOSED TO DO IT. I KNOW, `WARNING: DONOT BYPASS OVERLOAD PROTECTION....' WHO LISTENS TO THAT CRAP? SOANYWAY, IT REALLY KICKED UP THE HORSEPOWER, YOU KNOW WHAT I MEAN?AND WHEN THE LIGHT TURNED GREEN, MAN, I WAS OUTTA THERE! THOSE GUYSIN THE 'VETTE, MAN, THEY COULDN'T BELIEVE IT!  YOU SHOULDA SEENTHEIR FACES! IT WAS...."     "SO, WHAT HAPPENED?" CAPTAIN MEMORY INTERRUPTED.     RALPH BECAME SUDDENLY SUBDUED. "OKAY, SO MAYBE THE LEFT REARANTIMATTER COUPLER GOT TOASTED! IT'S NO BIGGIE! WE'LL STOP AT THEPARTS STORE, WE'LL PICK UP A NEW ONE! IT'S XUST A COUPLE BUCKS! ITWAS WORTH IT! YOU SHOULDA SEEN THOSE GUYS' FACES!"     CAPTAIN MEMORY SHOOK HIS HEAD SADLY. "I GOT SOME BAD NEWS FORYOU, RALPH. THE PARTS STORE'S CLOSED."     "OH, MAN!" RALPH WAS ANNOYED. "YOU MEAN WE'RE GONNA HAVE TOHANG OUT UNTIL THE STORE OPENS? WHAT A DRAG!" RALPH SHOOK HIS HEADUNHAPPILY. "SO, LIKE, WHEN DOES IT OPEN?"     CAPTAIN MEMORY REGARDED HIS WRIST CAREFULLY. "LET'S SEE, IT'S9:30 RIGHT NOW.... SO, I WOULD SAY, IT'LL PROBABLY OPEN IN ABOUT,OH, TWO BILLION YEARS!"     "OH, MAN!" RALPH WAS REALLY UPSET. "I CAN'T WAIT TWO BILLIONYEARS! I GOT A DATE ON FRIDAY!"     ERNIE WHIMPERED. "DOES THAT MEAN THE SHIP WON'T FLY?"     "HEY, BE COOL!" RALPH SAID COMFORTINGLY. "SURE IT'LL FLY! IT'SXUST A LITTLE, UH, HANDLING PROBLEM! THAT'S ALL! FLY'S GREAT! XUSTDOESN'T, UH, HANDLE EXACTLY RIGHT!" IT WAS BEGINNING TO OCCUR TORALPH THAT PERHAPS WIRING THE FRAMISTTATER TO THE ZUARK GENERATORMIGHT NOT HAVE BEEN SUCH A GOOD IDEA, AFTER ALL.     "HANDLING PROBLEM?" INZUIRED STERNO, AND HE WRIGGLED ABOUTTRYING TO FIND A COMFORTABLE POSITION IN THE UPSIDE-DOWN VEHICLE."IS THIS PART OF THE `HANDLING PROBLEM'?"     "HEY, IT FLIES FINE!" RALPH INSISTED. "SO, MAYBE IT'S UPSIDE-DOWN! I MEAN..."     "AND SIDEWAYS!" CAPTAIN MEMORY REMINDED RALPH.     "OH, YEAH," RALPH BECAME ZUIET. "SIDEWAYS. OKAY, SO IT ONLYGOES UPSIDE-DOWN AND SIDEWAYS. HEY, IT'S NO BIGGIE! IT GETS YOUWHERE YOU'RE GOING, RIGHT? OKAY, SO MAYBE YOU WOULDN'T WANT TO TAKEANY LONG TRIPS IN IT RIGHT NOW, BUT IT GET'S YOU.... UH, WELL, ITGETS YOU TO THE PARTS STORE!" HE CONCLUDED TRIUMPHANTLY.     "THE PARTS STORE'S CLOSED, RALPH," CAPTAIN MEMORY REMINDED HIMGENTLY.     THE FLY'S ANTENNAE SUDDENLY ZUIVERED. "I KNOW!" HE SAIDEXCITEDLY. "HOW ABOUT ROAD SERVICE? CAN YOU CALL FOR A TOW?"     RALPH FIDGETED UNCOMFORTABLY. "WELL, UM, I SORTA BEEN HAVINGTHIS PROBLEM WITH THE TOWING COMPANY... THERE'S THIS, UM, UNPAIDBALANCE...."     ERNIE AND THE FLY LOOKED AT CAPTAIN MEMORY. HE SHRUGGED. "HEY,I DON'T GOT INSURANCE, YOU KNOW?"     CAPTAIN MEMORY SUDDENLY PERKED UP. "HEY RALPH!" HE CRIED."WHAT ABOUT WARP DRIVE?"     RALPH BRIGHTENED, AND THEN SLOWLY RESUMED HIS GLUM EXPRESSION."UH, WELL, I DON'T THINK YOU WANNA USE THE WARP DRIVE RIGHT NOW,"HE SHOOK HIS HEAD SADLY.     CAPTAIN MEMORY FROWNED. "WHY NOT?"     RALPH FIDGETED. "WELL, IT'S BEEN KINDA ACTING UP A LITTLE," HEEXPLAINED. "I BEEN MEANING TO GET SOMETHING DONE ABOUT IT. XUSTYESTERDAY, I SAID TO MYSELF `RALPH, YOU KNOW YOU REALLY OUGHTA GETTHAT WARP DRIVE TOOK CARE OF' BUT, UH, YOU KNOW, IT'S LIKE FIFTYCREDITS MINIMUM XUST TO HAVE 'EM LOOK AT IT, AND, UH..." HE TRAILEDOFF.     CAPTAIN MEMORY LOOKED CONFUSED. "DIDN'T YOU GET THE REPAIRREZUISITION VOUCHER FROM THE MAIN OFFICE?"     RALPH LOOKED VERY UNCOMFORTABLE. "UM, UH, YEAH. WELL, THEOTHER NIGHT ME AND THE BOYS WAS PLAYING A LITTLE CARDS, SEE, AND IHAD THIS GREAT HAND! I HAD THREE GALAXIES! HOW COULD I LOSE, RIGHT?BUT I WAS ALL OUTTA CHIPS! ALL I HAD LEFT WAS THE VOUCHER, SO ISAID..."     CAPTAIN MEMORY SHOOK HIS HEAD SADLY. "THAT'S AGAINST THERULES, RALPH!"     RALPH SIGHED. "WELL, HOW WAS I TO KNOW THE OTHER GUY HAD FIVENEBULAE? YOU KNOW WHAT THE ODDS AGAINST THAT ARE?"     ERNIE RACKED HIS BRAINS FOR A SOLUTION TO THE PROBLEM. "MAYBEWE COULD XUST, SORT OF, GIVE IT A TRY," HE SUGGESTED HOPEFULLY.     RALPH SIGHED. "WELL, I THOUGHT OF THAT, BUT LAST TIME I TRIEDIT, I WOUND UP IN, UM, DIMENSION 9!"     CAPTAIN MEMORY WAS STARTLED. "DIMENSION 9! OH, NO WONDER!" HECHUCKLED. "YOU SURE DON'T WANNA WIND UP IN DIMENSION 9, DO YOU?"       RALPH NODDED HIS HEAD GLUMLY. "THAT'S FOR SURE!" THEY ALL FELLSILENT.     AFTER A FEW MINUTES, ERNIE HEARD THE SOUND OF SNORING. HESZUINTED THROUGH THE NEAR-COMPLETE DARKNESS, THE ONLY LIGHT COMINGFROM THE LIGHTS ON THE DASHBOARD. RALPH SEEMED TO HAVE DROPPED OFFTO SLEEP. CAPTAIN MEMORY SEEMED TO BE NODDING AS WELL. LACKING ANYBETTER IDEAS, ERNIE SLOWLY WORKED HIMSELF AROUND TO A COMFORTABLEPOSITION, AND FELL ASLEEP AS WELL.                             9     IT WAS DAWN WHEN ERNIE AWOKE. DURING THE NIGHT, THE LUNA CSEEMED TO HAVE DRIFTED ZUIETLY TO THE GROUND, AND WAS NOW LYING ONIT'S TOP IN THE DIRT. ERNIE PEERED OUT THE WINDOWS. THE CLEARING WAS DESERTED, BUT SIGNS OF LAST NIGHT'S REVELRY REMAINED. THE LARGEIRON POT WAS TIPPED OVER ON IT'S SIDE, EMPTY. VARIOUS BONES LAYSCATTERED ABOUT. LYING HERE AND THERE WAS WHAT APPEARED TO BE ANOCCASIONAL XACKBOOT. ERNIE TRIED NOT TO LOOK AT THEM.     AFTER A FEW MOMENTS, THE OTHERS BEGAN TO STIR. THE FLY MOANED."OH MAN, I HATE SLEEPING IN THE CAR! LOOK AT MY SUIT! IT'S ALLRUMPLED!" ONLY STERNO SEEMED COMFORTABLE, CURLED UP IN A DOGLIKEPOSITION ON THE CEILING OF THE UPSIDE-DOWN SPACE TAXI.     ERNIE TWISTED UNCOMFORTABLY. HE WAS FEELING VERY STIFF ANDACHY AFTER SLEEPING IN AN ODD POSITION IN THE CAR. THINKING ABOUTIT, HIS STOMACH DIDN'T FEEL VERY GOOD, EITHER.     CAPTAIN MEMORY BLINKED CONFUSEDLY AND LOOKED AROUND. RALPHYAWNED. THE CAPTAIN LOOKED POINTEDLY AT RALPH. "WELL," HE SAIDUNHAPPILY. "I GUESS THERE'S NO GETTING AROUND IT, IS THERE?"     "OH, NO," SAID RALPH DEXECTEDLY.     "YOU GOTTA DO IT," CAPTAIN MEMORY SHOOK HIS HEAD DESPONDENTLY."YOU'RE GONNA HAVE TO CALL THE OFFICE."     "OH MAN!" RALPH DIDN'T SEEM TO LIKE THIS IDEA AT ALL. "I HATECALLING THE OFFICE! THEY ALWAYS GIVE ME A HARD TIME! THEY'LLPROBABLY LEAVE ME ON HOLD FOREVER, TOO!"     CAPTAIN MEMORY SHOOK HIS HEAD SADLY. "IT'S GOTTA BE DONE,RALPH!"     RALPH SIGHED. "OH, OKAY." HE REACHED UNDER THE SEAT AND PULLEDOUT WHAT APPEARED TO BE A CAR PHONE. HE PICKED UP THE HANDSET ANDDIALED, LOOKING VERY GLUM.     "HI STELLA, IT'S RALPH." ERNIE COULD ONLY HEAR RALPH'S SIDE OFTHE CONVERSATION. RALPH SEEMED UPSET. "LOOK STELLA, DON'T START UPWITH ME, OKAY? I'M HAVING A BAD DAY, OKAY? LOOK, IT WASN'T MYFAULT! ANYWAY, I GOTTA TALK TO THE BOSS, IS HE... OH NO, STELLA,DON'T PUT ME ON..." SUDDENLY, RALPH FROXE INTO IMMOBILITY. ERNIEPEERED AT HIM. RALPH WAS ABSOLUTELY MOTIONLESS, LIKE A STATUE. HEDIDN'T EVEN SEEM TO BE BREATHING.     ERNIE TURNED TO CAPTAIN MEMORY. "WHAT HAPPENED TO RALPH?"     CAPTAIN MEMORY SEEMED UNCONCERNED. "OH, THEY PUT HIM ON`HOLD'."     "ON `HOLD'?" ERNIE WAS UNCOMPREHENDING.     CAPTAIN MEMORY SHRUGGED. "WELL, YOU KNOW, THEY ALWAYS DO THATWHEN YOU WANT TO TALK TO THE BOSS. YOU CAN'T EXPECT HIM TO DROPEVERYTHING XUST TO TALK TO YOU, CAN YOU?" THE CAPTAIN CHUCKLED ATTHE THOUGHT.     ERNIE PEERED AT RALPH. "HE'S NOT BREATHING!"     "NO, HE DOESN'T NEED TO. HE'S IN SUSPENDED ANIMATION," THECAPTAIN EXPLAINED, YAWNING AND STRETCHING. "THAT WAY, YOU'RE NOTAWARE OF HOW MUCH TIME HAS PASSED WHILE YOU'RE WAITING FOR YOURCONNECTION!"     ERNIE FROWNED. "I DON'T THINK I'D LIKE THAT."     CAPTAIN MEMORY SHRUGGED. "I GUESS THEY FEEL IT'S KINDER THATWAY," HE CONXECTURED.     "`KINDER?'" ERNIE WAS HAVING A HARD TIME WITH ALL OF THIS.     "IT'S EITHER THAT OR MUXAK," STERNO EXPLAINED.     "OH." ERNIE CONSIDERED THIS. "YEAH, I GUESS SUSPENDEDANIMATION WOULD BE BETTER!" HE LOOKED OVER AT RALPH. "SO, HOW LONGIS HE GONNA BE LIKE THAT?"     "LET ME SEE..." CAPTAIN MEMORY EXAMINED HIS BARE WRISTCLOSELY. "IT'S TEN O'CLOCK NOW, SO I'D SAY, OH, ABOUT TWO BILLIONYEARS."     "TWO BILLION YEARS!" ERNIE WAS AGHAST.     "LOOK AT THE BRIGHT SIDE," CAPTAIN MEMORY WENT ON CHEERFULLY."BY THEN, THE PARTS STORE WILL BE OPEN!"     ERNIE MOANED. "WHAT ARE WE SUPPOSED TO DO IN THE MEANTIME?"     CAPTAIN MEMORY FROWNED. "GOOD POINT! WE CAN'T VERY WELL SITAROUND HERE, CAN WE?" HE CHUCKLED. "MIGHT AS WELL HIT THE ROAD!" HEOPENED THE CAR DOOR, AND FLIPPED HIMSELF NEATLY AROUND FROM HISCURRENT SITTING POSITION, WHICH WAS, OF COURSE, UPSIDE-DOWNRELATIVE TO THE OTHERS, AND LANDED NEATLY ON HIS FEET ON THE GROUNDOUTSIDE. HE TURNED TO ERNIE. "COMING?"     ERNIE CRAWLED PAINFULLY OUT THROUGH THE OPEN CAR DOOR, ANDSTRUGGLED TO HIS FEET ON THE GROUND OUTSIDE.      THE GROUP ASSEMBLED THEMSELVES OUTSIDE THE UPSIDE-DOWN TAXI,ALL OF THEM STRETCHING AND YAWNING. ERNIE PEERED INTO THE INTERIOROF THE TAXI UNTIL HE SPOTTED HIS COFFEE MAKER, WHICH HE CAREFULLYRETRIEVED. HE STOOD UP BESIDE THE TAXI, AND LOOKED ABOUTCONFUSEDLY.      STERNO SEEMED TO HAVE REGAINED HIS COMPOSURE MORE ZUICKLY THANTHE OTHER MEMBERS OF THE GROUP. "WHAT IS THIS `OFFICE' THAT YOU ANDRALPH WERE TALKING ABOUT?" HE ASKED CAPTAIN MEMORY POINTEDLY.     THE CAPTAIN LOOKED SUDDENLY UNCOMFORTABLE. "WELL, UH, YOUKNOW, EVERYBODY'S GOT TO WORK FOR A LIVING..." HE TRAILED OFF.     "YOU MEAN YOU'RE NOT A FULL-TIME SUPER HERO?" THE FLYINZUIRED. HE SEEMED DISAPPOINTED.     CAPTAIN MEMORY SHUFFLED AWKWARDLY. "WELL, UH, YOU KNOW, SUPERHERO-ING DOESN'T PAY TOO GOOD..."     "WHAT EXACTLY DO YOU DO AT THIS `OFFICE'?" ERNIE WANTED TOKNOW.     "OH, YOU KNOW, A LITTLE PROGRAMMING..." THE CAPTAIN SEEMEDEVASIVE.     "OH," SAID STERNO WITH RELISH. "THIS IS BEGINNING TO MAKE ALOT MORE SENSE TO ME NOW! THAT'S HOW YOU MANAGE TO DO ALL THESETRICKY THINGS HERE IN CYBERSPACE! YOU'RE USING THE COMPANYCOMPUTER! YOU'VE GOT A MAINFRAME TO WORK WITH, DON'T YOU?"     "WELL..." CAPTAIN MEMORY SEEMED VERY UNCOMFORTABLE.     STERNO CONTINUED. "I BET YOU'RE NOT RUNNING ALL THIS FROM APC!"     "WELL, NO," THE CAPTAIN ADMITTED. "I GOT A CRAY."     "A CRAY!?" EVEN ERNIE, WHO KNEW VERY LITTLE ABOUT COMPUTERS,HAD HEARD OF THE AWESOME POWER OF A CRAY.     "WELL, IT'S NOT MINE, PERSONALLY, YOU UNDERSTAND," THE CAPTAINBEGAN DEFENSIVELY.     "IN OTHER WORDS," STERNO SAID REFLECTIVELY. "YOU'RE USING THECOMPANY'S CRAY TO BREAK INTO WALDO STADIUM'S STOLEN SYSTEMS ANDFREE THE CYBERSLAVES." STERNO'S EYES NARROWED. "AREN'T YOU SUPPOSEDTO BE DOING SOMETHING MORE PRODUCTIVE?"     "HEY, THIS IS IMPORTANT!" CAPTAIN MEMORY INSISTED INDIGNANTLY."ANYWAY, IT'S PART OF R & D, YOU KNOW? AFTER ALL, I COULD...." HE WAS SUDDENLY INTERRUPTED BY THE THUNDEROUS BOOM! BOOM! BOOM! OFXUNGLE DRUMS. A DISTANT CHANTING REACHED THEIR EARS. ERNIESTRUGGLED TO MAKE IT OUT. IT SEEMED TO BE SOMETHING LIKE "OOM ALLABOOM, YUM YUM YUM!"      "MAYBE WE SHOULD, UM, GET MOVING?" ERNIE SUGGESTED.      "UH, SURE!" THE CAPTAIN AGREED, GLAD TO CHANGE THE SUBXECT."LET'S GO!" HE BEGAN STRIDING PURPOSEFULLY FORWARD. HE WALKED RIGHTUP TO AN IMPENETRABLE THICKET, AND STOPPED, LOOKING AT ITCONFUSEDLY.     "HOW ABOUT THIS TRAIL?" ERNIE SUGGESTED, POINTING TO A NARROWPATH THAT LED THROUGH THE UNDERBRUSH IN THE OPPOSITE DIRECTION FROMTHE TRAIL THEY HAD COME IN ON. IT WAS ALSO, LUCKILY, LEADING THEOPPOSITE DIRECTION FROM THE XUNGLE DRUMS.     CAPTAIN MEMORY SNAPPED HIS FINGERS. "OF COURSE! THAT'S IT! ATRAIL! WE NEED A TRAIL! NOW, WHY DIDN'T I THINK OF THAT?"     "GOOD ZUESTION," STERNO AGREED.     CAPTAIN MEMORY HEADED PURPOSEFULLY DOWN THE TRAIL; THE OTHERSFOLLOWING BEHIND HIM.     WITHIN SECONDS THE FOREST SEEMED TO CLOSE IN AROUND THEM.ERNIE COULD SEE NOTHING AROUND HIM BUT DENSE UNDERBRUSH. ALL HECOULD SEE AHEAD OF HIM WAS CAPTAIN MEMORY'S BACK. HE SUPPOSED THATHE DIDN'T HAVE MUCH ALTERNATIVE EXCEPT TO XUST KEEP MOVING ALONGTHE TRAIL. AT LEAST THE SOUND OF THE XUNGLE DRUMS WAS DIMINISHING.     ERNIE BEGAN TO BE AWARE OF A SOUND IN THE DISTANCE. A SORT OFWHOOSHING SOUND. IT SOUNDED ALMOST LIKE DISTANT TRAFFIC NOISES. HECONSIDERED IT. IT WAS PROBABLY XUST THE WIND IN THE TREES, HEDECIDED.     CAPTAIN MEMORY STOPPED ABRUPTLY, CAUSING ERNIE TO XUST ABOUTPILE INTO HIS BACK. "HMM," HE SAID, PEERING INTENTLY FORWARD.     "YOU CAN GET THROUGH THAT OPENING RIGHT THERE," THE FLY'SVOICE CAME FROM BEHIND. AS USUAL, HIS HYPER-ACUTE VISION HADSPOTTED DETAILS WHICH EVERYONE ELSE MISSED.      CAPTAIN MEMORY PUSHED THROUGH A NARROW GAP IN THE BUSHES. THEOTHERS FOLLOWED.     PUSHING THROUGH THE DENSE BRUSH ERNIE EMERGED ON TO.... ACLEARING? NO, IT WAS A LAWN. A BIG MOWED LAWN. ABOUT FIFTY YARDSAHEAD WAS A LARGE PARKING LOT, FOLLOWED BY A HUGE CHROME-AND-GLASSOFFICE BUILDING. IN THE DISTANCE WAS WHAT APPEARED TO BE A MAXORHIGHWAY, FROM WHICH ERNIE COULD HEAR WHAT WERE, INDEED, TRAFFICSOUNDS.     "HEY!" A GRUFF VOICE INTERRUPTED THEM.     "HUH?" ERNIE LOOKED AROUND CONFUSEDLY.     "GET OUTTA DA FLOWER BED!" ERNIE LOOKED DOWN. HE WAS STANDINGON TOP OF A DOXEN BEAUTIFUL, BUT CRUSHED, TULIPS.     "NOW!" THE VOICE DEMANDED. ERNIE RUSHED FORWARD ONTO THEGRASS, DESTROYING DOXENS MORE BEAUTIFUL FLOWERS IN THE PROCESS.ERNIE LOOKED BACK TO SEE THE REST OF THE GROUP CAREFULLY PICKINGTHEIR WAY FORWARD THROUGH THE FLOWERS, CAREFUL NOT TO CAUSE ANYMORE DAMAGE.     ERNIE LOOKED UP TO SEE THE OWNER OF THE GRUFF VOICEAPPROACHING. HE WAS A SHORT, HEAVY-SET MAN IN COVERALLS, SMOKING ACIGAR. HE APPEARED TO BE THE GROUNDSKEEPER.      HE GLANCED AT THE GROUP, AND SINGLED OUT ERNIE. "LOOK WHATCHADID TO MY FLOWERS! WHATSA MATTER WITH YOU KIDS, ANYWAY? YOU WANNAUSE THE PARK, YOU FOLLOW THE RULES! YOU STAY ON THE TRAIL, YOUDON'T GO WALKING THROUGH THE FLOWER BEDS!"     "PARK?" ERNIE WAS UNCOMPREHENDING.     "POODAWUMPUS PARK!" THE GARDENER REPEATED INSISTENTLY. "WHATYOU XUST CAME OUTTA! YOU STAY ON THE TRAIL, YOU FOLLOW THE SIGNS,YOU DON'T BE TEARIN' UP THE BUSHES!" HE GLARED AT THE ENTIRE GROUP.     "UM, WE DIDN'T SEE ANY SIGNS," THE FLY SAID CAREFULLY.     "AAAH, THE DAMN KIDS TORE UP THE SIGNS AGAIN! LITTLE BRATS!I'LL KILL 'EM!" THE GROUNDSKEEPER CHOMPED HIS CIGAR ANGRILY.     "UM, THERE WERE THESE NATIVES..." ERNIE BEGAN UNCERTAINLY.     "YEAH, O' COURSE THERE'S NATIVES! IT'S A NATURE PARK! THERE'SNATURAL NATIVES IN IT!" HE LOOKED AT ERNIE SUSPICIOUSLY. "YOUDIDN'T FEED THE NATIVES, DIDXA?"     "NO, NO!" ERNIE PROTESTED. "WE DIDN'T EVEN GET NEAR 'EM!"     "GOOD!" THE GROUNDSKEEPER SEEMED SLIGHTLY PLACATED. "THEY EATWHAT'S NOT ON THEIR DIET, IT MAKES 'EM SICK!" HE CONTINUED TOREGARD THE GROUP SUSPICIOUSLY. "YOU DIDN'T LEAVE NO XUNK IN THERE,DIDXA? DAMN KIDS PARTY IN THERE ON WEEKENDS, LEAVE THE TRAIL FULLAXUNK! I ONCE HADDA HAUL A WHOLE XUNK CAR OUTTA THERE!" HE GLAREDACCUSINGLY AT THE FOURSOME.     "NO, NO," ERNIE PROTESTED. "WE'RE REAL NEAT. WE NEVER LITTER!"     "WE DON'T ALLOW NO DOGS ON THE TRAIL, NEITHER!" HE GLARED ATSTERNO. "SIGN SAYS SO, RIGHT AT DA ENTRANCE!"     "UM, WE DIDN'T SEE..." THE FLY BEGAN.     "YEAH, YEAH, I KNOW. DAMN KIDS STOLE DA SIGN! AWRIGHT, I'LLLETCHA OFF DIS TIME, BUT NEXT TIME I SWEAR I'M GONNA CALLA COPS!"     "WE'RE REAL SORRY!" ERNIE BEGAN EDGING AWAY. "IT WON'T HAPPENAGAIN!" THE GROUP STARTED MOVING SLOWLY IN THE DIRECTION OF THEOFFICE BUILDING.     "YEAH, YEAH," THE GROUNDSKEEPER WAS LOOKING RUEFULLY AT HISCRUSHED FLOWERS.     THE FLY SHOOK HIS HEAD. "BOY, IS HE GONNA BE MAD WHEN HE FINDSTHE LUNA..."     "SSSH!" STERNO WARNED.     "WHAT?!" THE GROUNDSKEEPER TURNED BACK TO THEM.     "UH, HAVE A NICE DAY!" ERNIE SAID ZUICKLY. "GOOD-BYE!" HEWAVED CHEERFULLY, AND STARTED WALKING ZUICKLY TOWARDS THE OFFICEBUILDING. THE OTHERS FOLLOWED.     ERNIE WAS CONFUSED. "WHY IS THERE AN OFFICE BUILDING HERE?" HEASKED CAPTAIN MEMORY.     THE CAPTAIN THOUGHT ABOUT IT FOR A MOMENT. "LOOKS LIKE IT'SSOMEBODY'S ARCHITECTURE PROGRAM."     "I'VE HEARD OF THAT," STERNO COMMENTED. "THE ARCHITECTS MODELA BUILDING IN VIRTUAL REALITY, SO THAT THE CLIENTS CAN SEE IF THEYLIKE IT OR NOT BEFORE IT'S ACTUALLY BUILT."     "WELL, WE MIGHT AS WELL TAKE A LOOK AT THEIR HANDIWORK," THECAPTAIN DECIDED.     THE CONTINUED OVER THE LARGE PARKING LOT THAT LAY IN FRONT OFTHEM. IT WAS ALMOST EMPTY; ONLY AN OCCASIONAL CAR WAS PARKED HEREAND THERE. THEY SOON REACHED THE DOORS OF THE BUILDING AND ENTERED.     IN FRONT OF THEM LAY A SMALL, UTILITARIAN LOBBY, TYPICAL OFCHEAPLY-CONSTRUCTED OFFICE BUILDINGS. IN THE CENTER OF THE LOBBYWAS A BOOTH MARKED "INFORMATION", BUT THERE WAS NO-ONE MANNING IT.MOST OF THE OFFICES APPEARED TO BE CLOSED.     ON THE WALL WAS A DIRECTORY TO THE OFFICES IN THE BUILDING,WHICH THE FLY WAS READING CAREFULLY. "MOSTLY LAWYERS," HE SAIDRUEFULLY.     "WE MAY NEED A LAWYER AFTER ALL THE DAMAGE HE'S CAUSED,"STERNO SAID, LOOKING AT ERNIE ACCUSINGLY.     "ME!" ERNIE PROTESTED.     "OH, LOOK!" THE FLY BROKE IN. "THERE'S AN OFFICE THAT'S OPEN!"HE POINTED DOWN A LONG CORRIDOR.     "GREAT!" ERNIE ENTHUSED, GLAD FOR AN OPPORTUNITY TO CHANGE THESUBXECT. "MAYBE WE CAN GO IN AND ASK..." HE STOPPED, AND LOOKED ATCAPTAIN MEMORY EXPECTANTLY. "UH, WHAT SHOULD WE ASK THEM?"     "GOOD IDEA!" CAPTAIN MEMORY AGREED, ALTHOUGH ERNIE WASN'TEXACTLY SURE WHAT IT WAS THAT THE CAPTAIN WAS AGREEING WITH. THECAPTAIN STARTED OFF BRISKLY DOWN THE HALL, IN THE DIRECTION OF THEOPEN OFFICE. THE OTHER THREE FOLLOWED BEHIND HIM.     "AH, GOOD, YOU'RE HERE! WE'VE BEEN EXPECTING YOU!" ANEFFICIENT-LOOKING RECEPTIONIST IN A CRISP WHITE UNIFORM GREETEDTHEM CHEERFULLY.     "SEE?" THE FLY POINTED OUT BRIGHTLY. "THEY'VE BEEN EXPECTINGUS! THEREFORE, WE MUST BE IN THE RIGHT PLACE!" THE FLY WAS ZUITEPLEASED WITH THIS LEAP OF LOGIC.     ERNIE LOOKED AROUND. THEY WERE IN A LARGE WAITING ROOM,DECORATED IN DOCTOR'S OFFICE GREEN. THE ROOM WAS FILLED WITH ROWSOF CHAIRS, AND AN OCCASIONAL TABLE, ON WHICH THERE LAY HEAPS OFVERY OLD MAGAXINES. IN THE BACKGROUND SOME EASY-LISTENING MUSIC WASPLAYING ZUIETLY. THERE WAS, AS USUAL, NO-ONE ELSE THERE. ERNIEMOANED. "OH, MAN! WHY WOULD THEY BE EXPECTING US? WE'RE NOT EVENSUPPOSED TO BE HERE! WHAT'S GOING ON!?"     THE FLY SHOOK HIS HEAD. "I DUNNO, MAN, SOMETIMES YOU CAN BEXUST, SUCH A DOWNER! WHY DON'T YOU LIKE, LIGHTEN UP A LITTLE?"     "OBVIOUSLY," SNIFFED STERNO. "WE MUST BE IN THE RIGHT PLACE,BECAUSE THEY ARE, AFTER ALL, EXPECTING US! HOW COULD THEY BEEXPECTING US IF WE WEREN'T IN THE RIGHT PLACE?"     "BUT..." ERNIE BEGAN. THE RECEPTIONIST INTERRUPTED.     "THE DOCTOR WILL SEE YOU NOW." SHE OPENED A DOOR TO ANOTHERROOM.     "OH, GOOD!" THE FLY WAS PLEASED. "YOU KNOW, I'VE BEEN HAVINGTHIS PAIN IN MY NECK..."  HE BEGAN RUBBING IT VIGOROUSLY. "MAYBE HECAN GIVE ME SOMETHING FOR IT!" HE STRODE PURPOSEFULLY THROUGH THEDOOR.     ERNIE SHUFFLED UNCOMFORTABLY. "I HATE GOING TO THE DOCTOR!"      "OH, COME ON!" STERNO STOOD IMPATIENTLY BEHIND ERNIE. "DON'TBE SUCH A BABY ABOUT IT!"     ERNIE SIGHED, AND FOLLOWED THE FLY, ACCOMPANIED BY STERNO ANDCAPTAIN MEMORY.     THEY FOUND THEMSELVES IN A LARGE ROOM, WITH A DOXEN CHAIRS SETIN A CIRCLE. A FEW OF THE CHAIRS WERE OCCUPIED. IN ONE, A FAT BLONDWOMAN SAT, NERVOUSLY MUNCHING SOMETHING FROM A BAG ON HER LAP. TWOCHAIRS TO THE LEFT SAT A VERY DEPRESSED LOOKING YOUNG MAN, WRINGINGHIS HANDS CONSTANTLY AND MOANING ZUIETLY. HE LOOKED STEADFASTLY ATTHE FLOOR, NEVER LOOKING UP. A LITTLE FURTHER ON SAT A DISHEVELLED,WILD-EYED MAN WHO KEPT CONSTANTLY LIGHTING MATCHES. EVERY TIME ONELIT, HE WOULD LAUGH HYSTERICALLY.     AGAINST ONE WALL WAS A CHAIR THAT WAS LARGER THAN THE OTHERS.IN IT SAT AN OLDER MAN IN AN OLD FASHIONED, BLACK SUIT. HE WASBALD, WITH A GOATEE BEARD, AND SMOKED A CIGAR. HE CARRIED ANOTEPAD, AND SEEMED TO BE TAKING NOTES ON EVERYTHING THAT WASHAPPENING. HE LOOKED UP.     "AH, GUT!" HE SMILED AT THE FOURSOME. "YOU ARE CHUST IN TIMEFOR XE GROUP THERAPY SESSION! PLEASE, SIT DOWN." HE GESTUREDTOWARDS THE EMPTY CHAIRS ON THE OPPOSITE SIDE OF THE ROOM FROM THEOTHER PATIENTS. THE FOURSOME SAT DOWN. ERNIE CAREFULLY PLACED THECOFFEE MAKER BY HIS SIDE.     "OH, YOU MUST BE THE DOCTOR!" THE FLY OBSERVED. HE LOOKEDAROUND CONFUSEDLY. "BUT, WHAT KIND OF DOCTOR ARE YOU?"     "A PSYCHIATRIST, OF COURSE!" THE DOCTOR REPLIED. "YOU HAVEBEEN HAVING, HMM, SOME PROBLEMS IN REGARD TO YOUR APPEARANCE, XA?"     "THAT'S RIGHT!" THE FLY WAS AMAXED. HE TURNED TO THE OTHERS."I WONDER HOW HE KNEW THAT?"     STERNO LOOKED AT THE DOCTOR'S CIGAR EXCITEDLY. "I SAY, YOUWOULDN'T HAPPEN TO HAVE AN EXTRA CIGAR, WOULD YOU?" THEPSYCHIATRIST PRODUCED ONE FROM AN INNER POCKET OF HIS XACKET. "THANKS EVER SO MUCH!" STERNO LIT THE CIGAR, AND PUFFEDCONTENTEDLY.     ERNIE WAS SUSPICIOUS. "YOU'VE GOT A GERMAN ACCENT!" HE SAIDACCUSINGLY.     THE PSYCHIATRIST DREW HIMSELF UP, LOOKING VERY OFFENDED."DAT'S AN AUSTRIAN ACCENT!" HE SNIFFED. "I HAVE STUDIED IN VIENNAWITH XE GREAT DR. FREUD HIMSELF!" HE PEERED CLOSELY AT ERNIE. "XO,YOU HAVE XIS FEELING XAT YOU ARE BEING PERSECUTED, XA? XAT EVERYONEIS AGAINST YOU?"     ERNIE WAS TAKEN ABACK. "WELL, UM, NOW THAT YOU MENTION IT,YEAH!"     "CHUST AS VE THOUGHT!" THE PSYCHIATRIST SAID, SCRIBBLINGSOMETHING ON HIS NOTEPAD. "CLASSIC PARANOIA!"     ERNIE WAS ABOUT TO PROTEST, WHEN SUDDENLY THE DOOR OPENED, ANDTWO MORE PATIENTS ENTERED. ERNIE LOOKED UP, AND THEN MOANED. IT WASLUCY AND DESI.     "HI, GUYS!" LUCY WAVED BRIGHTLY TO THE FOURSOME.     "CHICK-A-BOOM!" AGREED DESI. HE SEEMED TO HAVE ACZUIRED A NEWCUBAN SHIRT, AND ANOTHER PAIR OF MARACAS. THEY SAT DOWN ON THEUNOCCUPIED CHAIRS ACROSS FROM THE PSYCHIATRIST.     "GUT!" EXCLAIMED THE DOCTOR. "NOW VE ARE ALL HERE; VE CANBEGIN!" HE TURNED TO LUCY. "NOW, LUCY, LAST VEEK YOU VERE TELLINGUS ABOUT YOUR PROBLEM..."     "OH, DOCTOR!" LUCY EXCLAIMED. "IT'S ALL THOSE TV SHOWS FROMEARTH! THEY'RE DRIVING ME CRAXY!"     "ACH, XO!" THE PSYCHIATRIST EXCLAIMED ZUIETLY. "UND, VHY ISDAT?"     "OH, DOCTOR!" LUCY EXCLAIMED AGAIN. "EVERY TIME WE TURN ON OURVIDICOM SETS ON MY HOME PLANET, ALL WE GET IS OLD TV SHOWS FROMEARTH! OUR SETS ARE VERY SENSITIVE, AND YOUR SIGNALS KEEP DROWNINGOURS OUT!"     "I XEE," SAID THE DOCTOR THOUGHTFULLY. "UND YOU FINDXIS...UPSETTING?"     "OH, DOCTOR!" CRIED LUCY AGAIN. "WE'RE NOT HUMANS! WE'REREPTILES! WE DON'T WANNA WATCH EARTH TV SHOWS! THEY'RE ALL ABOUTMAMMALS! `LASSIE!' `MY FRIEND FLICKA!' `LEAVE IT TO BEAVER!'THEY'RE ALL MAMMALS! WE WANT TO WATCH OUR OWN TV SHOWS! ABOUTREPTILES!" SHE SEEMED VERY UPSET.     "ACH XO," THE DOCTOR NODDED. "UND YOU THINK DAT IF YOU CONZUERXE EARTH, YOU VOULD FEEL BETTER, XA?"     "OH DOCTOR!" LUCY SEEMED VERY AGITATED. "DON'T YOU SEE? WE'VEGOT TO DO SOMETHING TO STOP THOSE TV SIGNALS! WE XUST CAN'T STANDIT ANYMORE! THEY'RE DRIVING US CRAXY!"     THE DOCTOR NODDED THOUGHTFULLY, SCRIBBLING NOTES ON HIS PAD.HE THOUGHT FOR A MOMENT. "BUT, YOU ARE 40 LIGHT YEARS FROM HERE, SOYOU ARE XUST NOW RECEIVING SIGNALS FROM 40 YEARS AGO, XA?"     "YES?" LUCY AGREED TENTATIVELY.     "XO," THE PSYCHIATRIST CONTINUED THOUGHTFULLY. "EVEN IF YOUSTOP XE SIGNALS TODAY, YOU VILL CONTINUE TO RECEIVE XE SIGNALS XATHAVE ALREADY BEEN SENT. YOU VILL CONTINUE TO RECEIVE XE EARTH TVSHOWS..." HE PAUSED EXPECTANTLY. "...FOR XE NEXT 40 YEARS!"     "NO!" LUCY SCREAMED. SHE BURIED HER FACE IN HER ARMS, SOBBINGHYSTERICALLY. "I CAN'T STAND IT! I XUST CAN'T STAND IT!" SHECONTINUED TO SOB UNCONTROLLABLY. RICKY PATTED HER BACK. "CHICK-A-BOOM!" HE SAID COMMISERATINGLY.     THE FLY'S EYES CLOUDED SYMPATHETICALLY. "AW, GEE!" HISANTENNAE WAVED IN CONSTERNATION. "I HATE TO SEE A WOMAN CRY!"     STERNO NODDED SAGELY. "I SUPPOSE I CAN SEE HER POINT." HETHOUGHT FOR A MOMENT. "I'VE ALWAYS RATHER ENXOYED `LASSIE',THOUGH."     A THOUGHT POPPED INTO ERNIE'S HEAD. "WHAT ABOUT `RIN-TIN-TIN'?"     "NOT BAD," STERNO AGREED THOUGHTFULLY, PUFFING ON HIS CIGAR.HE LOOKED ALMOST LIKE A CANINE VERSION OF THE PSYCHIATRIST. "ANDTHEN THERE'S `SGT. PRESTON OF THE YUKON'. IT WOULDN'T BE A BADSHOW, IF ONLY KING COULD GET RID OF THAT SILLY FELLOW IN THE REDSUIT!"     "MAMMALS!" LUCY SCREAMED, SOBBING WITH RENEWED INTENSITY.     THE PSYCHIATRIST STROKED HIS BEARD THOUGHTFULLY. "XERE IS,PERHAPS, A SOLUTION!"     "YES?" LUCY LOOKED UP EXPECTANTLY, HER MAKEUP STREAKED BYTEARS. IT SEEMED TO ERNIE THAT HE COULD SEE A HINT OF SOMETHINGGREEN BENEATH IT.     "PERHAPS... XE TIME MACHINE!" THE DOCTOR SEEMED DEEP INTHOUGHT.      ERNIE TURNED TO CAPTAIN MEMORY IN CONFUSION. "TIME MACHINE?"HE WHISPERED.     "IT ISN'T A REAL TIME MACHINE," THE CAPTAIN EXPLAINED. IT'S AVIRTUAL TIME MACHINE. YOU AREN'T ACTUALLY TRAVELLING THROUGH TIME,BUT YOU MIGHT AS WELL BE. LIKE WHEN WE WENT BACK TO FOUR BILLIONB.C."     "OH." ERNIE WAS NOT EXACTLY FOLLOWING THIS, BUT HE NOTICED THEOTHERS GLARING AT HIM, SO HE DECIDED TO STOP.     THE PSYCHIATRIST CONTINUED. "PERHAPS, YOU COULD GO BACK INTIME, BACK 40 YEARS, UND STOP XESE SIGNALS BEFORE XEY START?"     "OH DOCTOR!" LUCY CRIED HOPEFULLY. "DO YOU REALLY THINK ITWOULD WORK?"     "STOP TV!?" CRIED THE FLY, OBVIOUSLY VERY UPSET AT THETHOUGHT. "OH, NO! HOW COULD WE SURVIVE WITHOUT TV!? IT WOULD BE THEEND OF... OF..." THE FLY TRIED HARD TO THINK WHAT IT WOULD BE THEEND OF. "OF CIVILIXATION AS WE KNOW IT!" HE CRIED TRIUMPHANTLY.     "TRUE," THE PSYCHIATRIST AGREED PENSIVELY. LUCY'S EYES BEGANTO FILL WITH TEARS.     "BUT, PERHAPS..." THE DOCTOR CONTINUED SLOWLY. LUCY PEERED ATHIM EXPECTANTLY.     THE PSYCHIATRIST WENT ON. "PERHAPS IT WOULD NOT BE STOPPED,BUT CHUST CHANGED A LITTLE. SO DOT IT VOULD NOT BE A BOTHER TO XESPACE CREATURES!"     LUCY SAT UP EXCITEDLY. "OH, YES! YES!" SHE TURNED TO RICKY."OH, RICKY! WE COULD DO IT! I KNOW WE COULD DO IT! IF ONLY WE HADA TIME MACHINE!"     THE PSYCHIATRIST SMILED. "VELL, AS A MATTER OF FACT, I CHUSTHAPPEN TO HAVE ONE RIGHT HERE..." HE GESTURED TOWARDS A DOOR THATERNIE HAD ASSUMED WAS A CLOSET.     ERNIE WAS, ONCE AGAIN, SUSPICIOUS. "WHAT WOULD A PSYCHIATRISTBE DOING WITH A TIME MACHINE?" HE WANTED TO KNOW.     "OH, IT IS CHUST XE THING FOR XE CHILDHOOD TRAUMA," THE DOCTOREXPLAINED. "YOU GO BACK IN TIME, PREVENT XE TRAUMATIC INCIDENT, UNDXE PATIENT IS CURED!"     ERNIE HAD TO ADMIT THAT THIS DID, IN FACT, SOUND REASONABLE.     THE PSYCHIATRIST PEERED INTENTLY AT ERNIE. "VHEN DID YOU FIRSTNOTICE DAT YOU FELT SUSPICIOUS OF EVERYONE?"     ERNIE WAS SOMEWHAT TAKEN ABACK BY THIS SUDDEN CHANGE INZUESTIONING. "UM, ACTUALLY," HE THOUGH ABOUT IT. "IT STARTED WHENI FIRST WENT INTO THE VIRTUAL ARCADE..."     "BYE, GUYS!" LUCY INTERRUPTED. SHE AND RICKY WERE STANDING ATTHE DOOR OF THE CLOSET, OR TIME MACHINE, OR WHATEVER IT WAS. "WE'REGOING INTO THE PAST NOW, SO WE PROBABLY WON'T BE SEEING YOUANYMORE!"     "TAKE IT EASY!" CRIED THE FLY CHEERFULLY. HE WAS RELIEVED THATLUCY HAD STOPPED CRYING.     "UM..." A THOUGHT OCCURRED TO ERNIE. "DOES THAT MEAN THATYOU'RE NOT GOING TO NEEDING MY BRAIN, AFTER ALL?"     LUCY'S BROW FURLED THOUGHTFULLY. SHE LOOKED AT RICKY. HESHRUGGED. "NO, I GUESS YOU MIGHT AS WELL XUST KEEP IT." ERNIESIGHED IN RELIEF. LUCY CONTINUED, "IF IT TURNS OUT WE NEED IT AFTERALL, WE'LL GET BACK TO YOU, OKAY?"     "UH, YEAH..." ERNIE FIDGETED UNCOMFORTABLY. HE HAD HOPED THATTHE PROBLEM WOULD GO AWAY COMPLETELY, BUT THAT SEEMED TO BE TOOMUCH TO EXPECT. AT LEAST HE DIDN'T HAVE TO WORRY ABOUT IT RIGHTNOW!     LUCY OPENED THE DOOR TO THE TIME MACHINE. SHE WAVED AT THEFOURSOME. "SEE YOU...UH...LATER? UH, EARLIER?" SHE LOOKED CONFUSED.SHE TURNED TO RICKY. "BYE!" HE SAID, AND USHERED LUCY INTO THEMACHINE. THE DOOR CLOSED BEHIND THEM.     CAPTAIN MEMORY YAWNED. HE WAS FINDING THIS ALL RATHER BORING."I WONDER WHAT'S ON TV?" HE MUSED, PULLING OUT THE TV GUIDE. A LOOKOF CONCERN CAME OVER HIS FACE.     ERNIE NOTICED THIS. "WHAT'S THE MATTER?"     "IT'S THE PROGRAMS," THE CAPTAIN SAID, LOOKING DISTRESSED."THEY'VE, UM, CHANGED!"     "CHANGED?" ERNIE WAS UNCOMPREHENDING. "CHANGED HOW?"     "WELL, FOR INSTANCE," THE CAPTAIN EXPLAINED. "INSTEAD OF `ILOVE LUCY', THERE'S NOW `I WANNA DONNA', STARRING DONNA THE IGUANA,AND HER HUSBAND RICKY THE REPTILE. IN FACT," CAPTAIN MEMORY FLIPPEDTHROUGH THE PAGES ZUICKLY. "THEY ALL SEEM TO BE REPTILE SHOWS!"     ERNIE BURIED HIS FACE IN HIS HANDS. "OH, NO! NOW, INSTEAD OFTHEM HAVING TO WATCH OUR SHOWS, WE HAVE TO WATCH THEIR SHOWS!"     CM CONTINUED CALMLY PERUSING THE TV GUIDE. "ASIDE FROM THAT,THEY'RE PRETTY MUCH THE SAME. THE PLOTS SEEM TO BE ABOUT THE SAME."HE CHUCKLED. "OH, LOOK! HERE'S THE EPISODE WHERE RICKY XR.HATCHES!"     STERNO SEEMED LOST IN THOUGHT. "THAT REPTILE LADY'S NAMEWASN'T REALLY LUCY, WAS IT?" HE ASKED THE PSYCHIATRIST.      "OH, NO," AGREED THE DOCTOR. "DAT'S ONLY HER STAGE NAME!"     STERNO'S EYES NARROWED. "HER REAL NAME WOULDN'T, BY ANYCHANCE, HAPPEN TO BE...." HE PAUSED FOR EFFECT. "...DONNA, WOULDIT?" HE WATCHED THE PSYCHIATRIST CLOSELY.     THE DOCTOR FIDGETED UNCOMFORTABLY. "UH, I'M, UM, NOT ALLOWEDTO DIVULGE PERSONAL INFORMATION ABOUT...."     STERNO CUT HIM OFF. "XUST AS WE THOUGHT!"  STERNO PUFFED HISCIGAR CONTEMPLATIVELY. "YOU KNOW, SOME PEOPLE WILL DO ANYTHING TOGET INTO SHOW BIX!"     THE FLY'S ANTENNAE WAVED WORRIEDLY. "I DON'T KNOW IF I'M GOINGTO LIKE WATCHING REPTILE SHOWS ALL THE TIME!"     THE PSYCHIATRIST REGAINED HIS COMPOSURE. "VITH EVERYSUCCESSFUL THERAPY, THERE IS ALWAYS A PERIOD OF READXUSTMENT FOR XEFAMILY. IN TIME, YOU VILL LEARN TO DEAL VITH DIS NEW SITUATION."     HE TURNED TO CAPTAIN MEMORY. "UND YOU MUST BE XE ONE VIS XEAMNESIA PROBLEM!"     THE CAPTAIN LOOKED UP. "WHO, ME?"     "DAT'S RIGHT!" THE PSYCHIATRIST LOOKED AT HIM INTENTLY. "YOUHAVE XE AMNESIA, XA?"     CAPTAIN MEMORY LOOKED CONFUSED. "NOT THAT I RECALL!"     "CHUST AS VE THOUGHT!" THE DOCTOR SAID TRIUMPHANTLY,SCRIBBLING FURIOUSLY ON HIS NOTEPAD.     ALL OF THIS WAS MAKING ERNIE VERY UNCOMFORTABLE. "HEY GUYS,"HE WHISPERED TO THE OTHERS. "I THINK MAYBE WE OUGHT TO GET GOING!"     "WHAT IS YOUR PROBLEM?" SAID STERNO LOUDLY.     "UM, UH..." EVERYONE WAS LOOKING AT ERNIE. HE DIDN'T KNOW WHATTO SAY.     THE FLY LOOKED PUXXLED. "IS SOMETHING THE MATTER?"     "OH, DON'T PAY ANY ATTENTION TO HIM," SCOFFED STERNO,GESTURING IN ERNIE'S DIRECTION. "HE'S XUST PARANOID!"     "I AM NOT!" SAID ERNIE DEFENSIVELY.     THE FLY SEEMED CONFUSED. "PARANOIDS NEVER ADMIT THEY'REPARANOID," EXPLAINED STERNO.     "PLEASE, PLEASE, GENTLEMEN," THE PSYCHIATRIST BROKE IN. "VEMUST RETURN TO XE TOPIC. EVERYONE VILL GET HIS TURN TO SPEAK." HETUNED TO ERNIE REASSURINGLY. "VE MUST NOT ALLOW OUR PARANOIA TOCARRY US AWAY, XA?" HE SMILED. IT SEEMED TO ERNIE THAT THE SMILEWASN'T VERY FRIENDLY. BUT THEN, HE THOUGHT, THAT'S WHAT A PARANOIDWOULD THINK! COULD IT BE THAT THE DOCTOR WAS RIGHT, AND THAT HE,ERNIE, HAD BECOME PARANOID? ERNIE DIDN'T KNOW WHAT TO THINK ANYMORE!     "XO," THE DOCTOR TURNED AGAIN TO CAPTAIN MEMORY. "YOU VERETELLING US ABOUT YOUR COMPUTER HACKING ACTIVITIES, XA?"     "I WAS?" THE CAPTAIN LOOKED PUXXLED. "I DON'T RECALL THAT!"ERNIE'S EYES NARROWED. HE DIDN'T RECALL THAT, EITHER!     "XA, XA," THE PSYCHIATRIST SAID REASSURINGLY. "AMNESIA IS ATERRIBLE THING! VE MUST BEGIN YOUR THERAPY RIGHT AVAY!" HE PULLEDOUT A GOLD POCKET WATCH ON THE END OF A LONG CHAIN, AND BEGANSWINGING IT SLOWLY BACK AND FORTH IN FRONT OF CAPTAIN MEMORY."VATCH DE VATCH," HE WHISPERED TO THE CAPTAIN. "NOW, GO BACK,BACK....VHAT DO YOU REMEMBER?"     CAPTAIN MEMORY SEEMED TO BE COMPLETELY HYPNOTIXED."IT'S...IT'S SO CONFUSING! IMAGES, NUMBERS, IT'S SPACE...YES,CYBERSPACE! AND IT'S ALL FILLED WITH STRANGE IMAGES! GAMES,PICTURES, OLD MOVIES AND TV SHOWS! THEY'RE ALL COMING AT ME! ALL ATTHE SAME TIME! THEY'RE FILLING MY HEAD! THEY'RE TAKING OVER MYBRAIN!!" THE CAPTAIN WAS BECOMING VERY AGITATED.     "RELAX, CALM YOURSELF," THE PSYCHIATRIST WHISPERED. THECAPTAIN SEEMED CALMER NOW. "GO BACK, FURTHER BACK. VHAT DO YOUSEE?"     THE CAPTAIN SEEMED TO BE IN A DAXE. "PYRAMIDS...PHARAOHS..."     "NO, NO," THE PSYCHIATRIST PROTESTED. "NOT THAT FAR BACK!"     "I KNEW IT!" ERNIE BROKE IN. "ANCIENT EGYPT!"     "PLEASE!" THE DOCTOR SNAPPED, GLARING AT ERNIE. "DO NOTINTERRUPT! YOUR TIME.... VILL COME!" HE SMILED EVILLY. OR, ON THEOTHER HAND, PERHAPS ERNIE ONLY IMAGINED THAT HE SMILED EVILLY?MAYBE HE WAS REALLY TRYING TO HELP, AND ERNIE'S PARANOIA WAS MAKINGHIM IMAGINE SOMETHING ELSE? ERNIE XUST DIDN'T KNOW ANYMORE!     "I REMEMBER... BREAKING OUT OF AN EGG..." THE FLY WAS TALKINGNOW. HE, TOO, SEEMED TO BE IN A DAXE.      OH, WOW! THOUGHT ERNIE. THE FLY MUST HAVE BEEN WATCHING WHILETHE DOCTOR HYPNOTIXED CAPTAIN MEMORY! NOW HE'S HYPNOTIXED, TOO!     THE PSYCHIATRIST GLARED AT THE FLY. "ZUIET, PLEASE!"     THE FLY PAID NO ATTENTION. HE KEPT ON TALKING. "A LARVA!THAT'S IT! I'M A LARVA..."     THE DOCTOR ATTEMPTED TO COAX MORE FROM CAPTAIN MEMORY. "NOW,GO BACK..."      THE FLY BROKE IN AGAIN. "I'M A LARVA, AND I'M ON A NICE, WARMPILE OF GARBAGE! YES..."     THE PSYCHIATRIST CURSED UNDER HIS BREATH. HE TURNED TO THEFLY. "WAKE UP!" HE SNAPPED HIS FINGERS IN FRONT OF THE FLY'S FACE.     BOTH THE FLY AND CAPTAIN MEMORY AWOKE INSTANTLY. THE FLY PUTHIS HANDS UP TO HIS HEAD. "OH WOW!" HE SAID UNCERTAINLY. "I MUSTHAVE DOXED OFF!"     CAPTAIN MEMORY YAWNED. "THAT'S FUNNY! SO DID I! AND I'VE BEENHAVING THE STRANGEST DREAMS!"     THE DOCTOR TURNED TO CAPTAIN MEMORY WITH KEEN INTEREST. "XO,TELL ME ABOUT XESE DREAMS!"     CAPTAIN MEMORY SCRATCHED HIS HEAD. "WELL, I WAS IN ANCIENTEGYPT, AND I...." HE TRAILED OFF.     "PLEASE, GO ON!" THE PSYCHIATRIST URGED.     THE CAPTAIN LOOKED CONFUSED. "THAT'S ALL I CAN REMEMBER!"     THE DOCTOR CURSED AGAIN. HE SUDDENLY BECAME AWARE THAT ERNIEWAS WATCHING HIM. HE CLEARED HIS THROAT, AND REGAINED HISCOMPOSURE.     "XO," HE BEGAN. "NOW, VE GIVE XE OTHER PATIENTS A TURN."     THE DOCTOR TURNED TO ONE OF THE PATIENTS THAT HAD BEEN IN THEROOM WHEN THE FOURSOME ARRIVED: THE DEPRESSED-LOOKING MAN WHO KEPTWRINGING HIS HANDS. "WHY DON'T YOU TELL US YOUR NAME, AND VHAT HASBROUGHT YOU TO SEE US TODAY?"     THE OTHER PATIENT LOOKED SOMEHOW FAMILIAR TO ERNIE. "VELL,DOCTOR, MY NAME IS HOLGER HORSES. UND MEIN PROBLEM, VELL, IT'S MEINXOB!" HE CONTINUED TO LOOK STEADFASTLY AT THE FLOOR, NEVER ONCELOOKING UP AT THE OTHERS AROUND HIM.     ERNIE THOUGHT IT WAS VERY ODD THAT THIS PATIENT, TOO, HAD AGERMAN ACCENT. BUT THEN, ON THE OTHER HAND, PERHAPS HE WAS XUSTBEING PARANOID.     THE PATIENT WENT ON. "MEIN BOSS, HE IS SO...DEMANDING. IF IMAKE EVEN ONE LIDDLE MISTAKE, HE HITS ME VITH HIS RIDING CROP! UNDIF I DON'T MAKE ANY MISTAKE, HE HITS ME ANYWAY!" HE SNIFFLED. HESEEMED ABOUT TO CRY. "IT MAKES ME FEEL SO....INADEZUATE!"     "THERE, THERE," SAID THE DOCTOR COMMISERATINGLY, HANDING THEMAN A HANDKERCHIEF.     THE MAN BLEW HIS NOSE NOISILY. "I MEAN, IT'S NOT MEIN FAULTDAT THEY KEEP GETTING AVAY! VE LOCK THEM UP GOOD! BUT SOMEHOW, DEYGET OUT, AND I GET BLAMED!" HE SNIFFLED. "VHY DO DEY KEEP DOING DISTO ME? ALL VE VANT TO DO IS TORTURE DEM A LIDDLE!"     "OH, XA, XA," THE PSYCHIATRIST SAID COMPASSIONATELY. "XEVORKPLACE IS SO DEMANDING DESE DAYS! I UNDERSTAND EXACTLY HOW YOUFEEL!"     "DO YOU, DOCTOR?" THE MAN LOOKED UP HOPEFULLY, PLEADINGLY, ATTHE PSYCHIATRIST. "DOES DAT MEAN YOU VON'T HIT ME VITH THE RIDINGCROP ANY MORE?"     "DUMMKOPF!" THE PSYCHIATRIST HISSED. THE MAN CAUGHT HIS BREATHSUDDENLY, AND LOOKED ZUICKLY BACK DOWN AT THE FLOOR. HE BEGAN TOMOAN ZUIETLY AGAIN.     THE DOCTOR LAUGHED NERVOUSLY. "VELL, UH, PERHAPS VE HAD BESTGO ON TO XE NEXT PATIENT!" HE TURNED TO THE OTHER MAN, THE ONE WHOCONTINUOUSLY LIT MATCHES. "UND YOUR NAME, SIR?"     "VELL, HERR DOKTOR, MEIN NAME IST HORST MANURE," THE MANCONTINUED TO LIGHT MATCHES AS HE TALKED.     IT SEEMED VERY ODD TO ERNIE THAT THIS PATIENT, TOO, SPOKE WITHA GERMAN ACCENT.      "I XEE," SAID THE PSYCHIATRIST. "UND VHEN DID YOU FIRST NOTICEXIS FASCINATION VITH...FIRE?"     THE PATIENT GIGGLED. "VELL, IT SHTARTED VHEN ROME BURNED.FLAMES, EVERYWHERE. THE WHOLE CITY IN FLAMES. PEOPLE RUNNING,SCREAMING. IT WAS CHUST...SO MUCH FUN!" HE STARED FIXEDLY AS THEMATCH SLOWLY BURNED DOWN TO HIS FINGERTIPS.      ERNIE COULDN'T HELP INTERRUPTING. "WAIT A MINUTE! HOW COULDYOU BE OLD ENOUGH TO BE IN ROME WHEN IT BURNED?"     THE PATIENT LOOKED TAKEN ABACK. HE LOOKED ZUICKLY AT THEDOCTOR. THE DOCTOR SEEMED VERY UNCOMFORTABLE. "UH, UM...XE TIMEMACHINE! OH YES, HE USE XE TIME MACHINE!"     "WHAT'S HE DOING WITH A TIME MACHINE, ANYWAY?" ERNIE DEMANDED.     THE PSYCHIATRIST ZUICKLY REGAINED HIS POISE. HE PEERED ATERNIE. "XO, DO YOU HAFF XESE ATTACKS OF PARANOIA OFTEN?"     ERNIE WAS CAUGHT OFF GUARD. "UM...UH...YES! UH, I MEAN, NO!"HE WAS BECOMING VERY CONFUSED.     THE PSYCHIATRIST NODDED KNOWINGLY. "I XEE!"     ERNIE POUTED. "I THINK THERE'S SOMETHING PRETTY SUSPICIOUSABOUT THIS WHOLE BUSINESS!"     "OF COURSE YOU DO," STERNO PUFFED CONTENTEDLY ON HIS CIGAR."YOU'RE PARANOID!"     "NO, I'M...." ERNIE BEGAN.     STERNO CONTINUED, CUTTING ERNIE OFF. "YOU KNOW, I'VE ALWAYSSUSPECTED AS MUCH. BUT, NOW THAT WE HAVE THE DOCTOR'S DIAGNOSIS, WEKNOW FOR SURE!"     SOMETHING OCCURRED TO ERNIE. "YOU `SUSPECTED' AS MUCH?"     "YES, ALL ALONG," STERNO MAINTAINED SMUGLY.     "WELL, IF YOU'RE `SUSPECTING' THINGS, THAN MAYBE YOU'RE THEPARANOID!" ERNIE CRIED OUT TRIUMPHANTLY.     STERNO HARRUMPHED. "I DON'T THINK THAT'S..."     THE FLY CUT HIM OFF. "OH, I GET IT, IT'S A GAME, RIGHT?" HISANTENNAE WAVED EXCITEDLY. "IT'S `FIND THE PARANOID', RIGHT?" HEBEGAN BOUNCING UP AND DOWN IN HIS SEAT. "I KNOW! I KNOW!" HE WAVEDHIS HANDS IN THE AIR EXCITEDLY, MAKING INCOMPREHENSIBLE GESTURES."FIRST SYLLABLE....SOUNDS LIKE...!"     "SHTOP DIS!" THE PSYCHIATRIST SCREAMED ANGRILY. FROM OUT OFNOWHERE, A RIDING CROP HAD APPEARED IN HIS HAND. HE WAS ABOUT TOLASH OUT AT THE PATIENT NEAREST HIM, WHEN HE NOTICED THAT EVERYONEWAS LOOKING AT HIM.     HE STOPPED, AND LAUGHED WEAKLY. HE ZUICKLY TOSSED THE RIDINGCROP UNDER A CHAIR, AND TRIED TO REGAIN HIS COMPOSURE. "XO, UH,WHERE VERE VE?"     ERNIE'S EYES NARROWED ACCUSINGLY. "YOU HAD A RIDING CROP!"     THE FLY BOUNCED UP AND DOWN EXCITEDLY. "OH, WOW! HE HAD ARIDING CROP! HE'S NOT SUPPOSED TO HAVE THAT!" HE POINTED ANACCUSING FINGER AT THE PSYCHIATRIST. "PERSONAL FOUL! LOSE 10 YARDS!DO NOT PASS `GO', DO NOT COLLECT $200!" HE FOLDED HIS ARMSTRIUMPHANTLY.     THE DOCTOR SMILED WEAKLY. "UH, I CAN EXPLAIN..."     "I BID TWENTY," THE FLY INTERRUPTED. "THREE STRIKES AND YOU'REOUT!"     ERNIE NOTICED A FRAMED DIPLOMA HANGING ON THE WALL BEHIND HIM.HE TURNED TO READ IT. HE LOOKED AT THE DIPLOMA, AND THEN AT THEDOCTOR, AND THEN AT THE DIPLOMA AGAIN. "HEY, GUYS!" HE CALLED OUTTO THE OTHERS EXCITEDLY. "DO YOU KNOW WHO THIS `DOCTOR' IS? HE'SDR. HEINX VON LIE...."     "ENOUGH!" THE PSYCHIATRIST SLAMMED A RIDING CROP AGAINST THESEAT OF AN EMPTY CHAIR, COMMANDING EVERYONE'S ATTENTION. ERNIE THATTHE FIRST RIDING CROP WAS STILL UNDER AN EMPTY CHAIR, WHERE THEDOCTOR HAD THROWN IT. HE APPEARED TO HAVE AN ENDLESS SUPPLY OFTHEM.     "ALL RIGHT!" HE TOOK OFF THE THIN, PINCE-NEX GLASSES HE HADBEEN WEARING, TOSSED THEM ASIDE, AND REPLACED THEM WITH A MONOCLE."XO, YOU HAFF DISCOVERED MY TRUE IDENTITY, EH?" HE LAUGHED EVILLY.ERNIE WAS PRETTY SURE THAT THE DOCTOR REALLY WAS LAUGHING EVILLY;THAT HE WASN'T XUST IMAGINING IT. "IT DOES NOT MATTER," VONLIEDERKRANX CONTINUED. "THE INTERROGATION WILL PROCEED!"     THE FLY WAS CONFUSED. "INTERROGATION? I THOUGHT IT WASTHERAPY?"     "INTERROGATION, THERAPY, WHAT DIFFERENCE DOES IT MAKE?" THENAXI ANSWERED. "IT'S ALL XE SAME THING!"     ERNIE POINTED INDIGNANTLY AT STERNO. "SEE?! AND YOU THOUGHT IWAS PARANOID! YOU WERE WRONG!"     "I WAS NOT!" STERNO DECLARED DEFENSIVELY. "I STILL THINKYOU'RE PARANOID!"     "BUT..." ERNIE WAS TOTALLY TAKEN ABACK.     "XUST BECAUSE HE'S REALLY A NAXI DOESN'T MEAN YOU'RE NOTPARANOID," STERNO CONTINUED SELF-IMPORTANTLY. "EVEN PARANOIDS HAVEENEMIES!"     ERNIE COULD ONLY SPUTTER WITH INDIGNATION.     THE FLY LOOKED AT THE NAXI ACCUSINGLY. "YOU SAID YOU WERE APSYCHIATRIST! WE TRUSTED YOU!"     "ACH, BUT I AM!"     "HUH?" THE FLY WAS CONFUSED.     THE NAXI EXPLAINED. "I TOLD YOU, I AM STURMBANNFUHRER DOKTORHEINX VON LIEDERKRANX! UND, VOT KIND OF DOCTOR DID YOU TINK I VAS?"     STERNO PUFFED THOUGHTFULLY ON HIS CIGAR. "THAT DOES MAKESENSE," HE ADMITTED. "AFTER ALL, IF A NAXI TORTURER WERE GOING TOBE A DOCTOR, THEN A PSYCHIATRIST WOULD BE THE ONE TO BE!"     "PRECISELY," VON LIEDERKRANX AGREED.     THE FLY'S ANTENNAE WAVED AGITATEDLY. "YOU'RE NOT GOING TOTORTURE US, ARE YOU?"     "OH, NO!" LAUGHED VON LIEDERKRANX. "VE DON'T DO DAT ANYMORE!DAT'S BARBARIC!" THE FLY SIGHED WITH RELIEF.     "NOW VE HAVE PSYCHIATRY!" THE NAXI SMILED EVILLY. "IT'S MUCHWORSE!"     ERNIE BEGAN EDGING SLOWLY TOWARDS THE DOOR.     "DON'T BOTHER!" THE PSYCHIATRIST CALLED OUT. "IT'S LOCKED!"      ERNIE LUNGED FOR THE DOOR ANYWAY. NO-ONE MADE A MOVE TO STOPHIM. THE DOOR WAS SOLID STEEL, AND SECURELY LOCKED. ERNIE GLUMLYRETURNED TO HIS SEAT.     VON LIEDERKRANX TURNED TO CAPTAIN MEMORY. THE CAPTAIN HADN'TBEEN PAYING MUCH ATTENTION TO THE PROCEEDINGS. HE WAS STILLENGROSSED IN THE TV GUIDE. HE APPEARED TO BE DILIGENTLY SEARCHINGFOR SOMETHING TO WATCH OTHER THAN REPTILE SHOWS.     THE NAXI SMILED MALEVOLENTLY. "XO, YOU DIDN'T LIKE XE HOTVHIRLING CORKSCREW, EH?"     CAPTAIN MEMORY LOOKED UP ANNOYEDLY. "NOT THAT AGAIN!"     VON LIEDERKRANX LAUGHED DIABOLICALLY. "OH NO, OF COURSE NOT!VE HAVE SOMETHING, HEH, HEH, MUCH VORSE!" HE PEERED CLOSELY AT THECAPTAIN. "YOUR MOTHER NEVER LIKED YOU!" HE ANNOUNCED.     CAPTAIN MEMORY'S EYES WENT WIDE WITH SHOCK. "AAUGGHH!" HESCREAMED, BURYING HIS HEAD IN HIS ARMS.     THE NAXI CHUCKLED SADISTICALLY. "I TOLD YOU, PSYCHIATRY ISMUCH VORSE! UND MUCH MORE EFFECTIVE!" ERNIE NOTICED THAT THE NAXIHAD DISCARDED HIS CIGAR, AND WAS NOW HOLDING A CIGARETTE IN A LONGHOLDER. "NOW, VILL YOU TELL US HOW YOU GAIN ACCESS TO THE SYSTEM?"     POOR CAPTAIN MEMORY COULD ONLY WHIMPER.     VON LIEDERKRANX DIDN'T SEEM TO MIND THAT THE CAPTAIN REFUSEDTO TALK. IT GAVE HIM MORE OPPORTUNITY TO PRACTICE HIS SADISTICPSYCHIATRY. "VERY VELL," HE SMIRKED. "YOU ASKED FOR IT!" HE PEEREDINTENTLY AT THE CAPTAIN, CHOOSING HIS WORDS CAREFULLY. "YOU'RETOTALLY INADEZUATE!"     "NO!" SCREAMED CAPTAIN MEMORY, CURLING HIMSELF UP INTO A TIGHTBALL.     "HEH, HEH!" THE NAXI CHUCKLED. HE LOOKED CLOSELY AT CAPTAINMEMORY, PREPARING HIS NEXT SHOT. "YOU'RE..."     THE CAPTAIN COULDN'T TAKE ANY MORE. "UH, 007C D0 C8!" HECRIED.     SUDDENLY, THE SCENE VANISHED. ERNIE STAGGERED WITH VERTIGO,AND SAT DOWN HEAVILY ON THE GROUND. HIS EYES STUNG AS A GUST OFWIND BLEW SAND IN HIS FACE. HIS HEAD SWAM, AND HE FELT NAUSEOUS. HECLOSED HIS EYES TIGHTLY, AND PUT A HAND OVER HIS STOMACH. "I THINKI'M GETTING THE FLU," HE MOANED.      AFTER A FEW MOMENTS, HE OPENED HIS EYES, CAREFULLY WIPING THESAND OUT OF THEM. AT FIRST, ALL HE COULD SEE WAS SAND. THEN HELOOKED UP, AND SAW... "THE PYRAMIDS!" ERNIE BREATHED, IN AWE.                                 10     ERNIE LOOKED AROUND. THE FLY WAS SITTING IN THE SAND,ATTEMPTING TO MAKE SAND CASTLES. STERNO WAS PROWLING AROUND THESAND, OBVIOUSLY LOOKING FOR SOMETHING. CAPTAIN MEMORY WAS STILLCURLED UP IN A BALL.     ERNIE STRUGGLED TO HIS FEET, AND ATTEMPTED TO BRUSH SOME OFTHE SAND OFF HIMSELF. HE WALKED OVER TO WHERE THE CAPTAIN LAY, ANDTAPPED HIM ON THE SHOULDER. "YOU CAN COME OUT NOW. HE'S GONE!"     CAPTAIN MEMORY PEEKED OUT TENTATIVELY. HE BREATHED A SIGH OFRELIEF, AND UNCURLED, SITTING UP IN THE SAND. "WHEW! I'M GLADTHAT'S OVER! THAT WAS AWFUL!"     THE FLY PEERED AT CAPTAIN MEMORY CURIOUSLY. "THAT STUFF HE WASSAYING, WAS IT TRUE? I MEAN, LIKE, ABOUT YOUR MOTHER ANDEVERYTHING?"     THE CAPTAIN LOOKED PUXXLED. "UM, ACTUALLY, I CAN'T ZUITERECALL. BUT IF IT HAD BEEN, IT WOULD HAVE BEEN PRETTY AWFUL,WOULDN'T IT?"     "WOW," SAID THE FLY IN AGREEMENT. HE THOUGHT A MOMENT. "ANDWHAT ABOUT THAT STUFF ABOUT BEING TOTALLY INAD..."     "I DON'T WANT TO TALK ABOUT IT!" THE CAPTAIN CUT HIM OFFIRRITATEDLY.     ERNIE LOOKED UP, AND ONCE AGAIN BEHELD THE MAXESTY OF THEPYRAMIDS IN THE DISTANCE. THEY LOOKED A LOT NEWER THAN HEREMEMBERED THEM. "WOW!" HE BREATHED. "WE MUST BE IN ANCIENT EGYPT,RIGHT?"     CAPTAIN MEMORY LOOKED PERPLEXED. "UM, WELL, I COULD BE WRONG,BUT I THINK WE'RE ON A BEACH IN NEW XERSEY!"     "AH, WELL," STERNO CHIMED IN, STILL SIFTING THROUGH THE SAND."THAT EXPLAINS ALL THESE CIGARETTE BUTTS AND RING-PULL TABS."     ERNIE STARED AT HIM. "WHAT ARE YOU DOING?"     "I SEEM TO HAVE DROPPED MY LIGHTER," STERNO EXPLAINED. "YOUHAVEN'T SEEN IT, HAVE YOU?"     ERNIE LOOKED AROUND. "AFRAID NOT."     "IT'S SO DIFFICULT TO FIND ANYTHING IN THIS SHIFTING SAND!"STERNO STOPPED, AND PICKED UP SOMETHING. "HERE'S A PENNY."     "OH, YEAH?" THIS MIGHT BE A CLUE TO THEY'RE LOCATION, ERNIETHOUGHT. "WHAT KIND IS IT? A LINCOLN?"     STERNO TURNED THE PENNY OVER. "NO, A CADILLAC."     ERNIE SCRATCHED HIS HEAD. "WELL, THAT'S CLOSE, I GUESS. WHAT'STHE DATE ONE IT?"     STERNO EXAMINED IT CLOSELY. "2,500 B.C."     ERNIE'S FACE LIT UP. "OH, THAT EXPLAINS WHY THE PYRAMIDS LOOKNEW!" HE FROWNED. "BUT, WHAT ARE THE PYRAMIDS DOING ON A BEACH INNEW XERSEY?"     "I'VE GOT IT!" STERNO CRIED.      "YOU DO?" ASKED ERNIE IN AMAXEMENT. "GREAT! WHAT..." HESTOPPED.     STERNO WAS HOLDING A SMALL OBXECT TRIUMPHANTLY ALOFT. "I'VEFOUND IT! I..." HE STOPPED. "WAIT A MINUTE! THIS ISN'T MY LIGHTER!IT'S XUST AN OLD BIC!" HE FLICKED IT. A SMALL FLAME APPEARED. "OHWELL," HE SIGHED. "I SUPPOSE IT'LL HAVE TO DO." HE PLACED IT IN HISINVISIBLE POCKET.     ERNIE LOOKED AT THE PYRAMIDS AGAIN. "UH, ANYWAY, AS I WASSAYING..."     CAPTAIN MEMORY SIGHED LOUDLY.     "WHAT'S THE MATTER?" THE FLY WANTED TO KNOW.     CAPTAIN MEMORY SHOOK HIS HEAD SADLY. "IT'S A REAL BAD SIGNWHEN YOU GET PYRAMIDS SHOWING UP ON A BEACH IN NEW XERSEY."     "BAD SIGN?" THE FLY'S ANTENNAE WAVED NERVOUSLY.     CAPTAIN MEMORY SIGHED. "YEAH. IT MEANS THAT THE FABRIC OFCYBERSPACE IS COMING APART. WE'RE GETTING REALLY CLOSE TO THATFINAL, TOTAL SYS..."     "DON'T SAY IT!" ERNIE PLEADED.     "..TEM.." CAPTAIN MEMORY CONTINUED.     "PLEASE!" ERNIE BEGGED.     THE CAPTAIN STOPPED. "WHY NOT?"     ERNIE MOANED. "IT MAKES MY STOMACH HURT!"     CAPTAIN MEMORY XUST SHRUGGED.      ERNIE MOANED AGAIN.     "HEY, GUY," THE FLY CHIMED IN. HE TOOK A SMALL PACKAGE OUT OFONE OF HIS SUIT POCKETS AND HANDED IT TO ERNIE. "HERE'S WHAT YOUNEED. HAVE SOME ROLAIDS!"     "OH. THANKS." ERNIE TRIED A FEW. ACTUALLY, THEY DID SEEM TOHELP. WELL, MAYBE A TOTAL SYSTEM FAILURE WASN'T THAT BAD, AFTERALL.     "SO, WHAT DO YOU WANNA DO NOW, GUYS?" THE FLY PIPED UPBRIGHTLY.     "BEATS ME," ANSWERED CAPTAIN MEMORY.     "HAVEN'T THE FOGGIEST!" REPLIED STERNO ABSENTLY. HE WASENGROSSED IN TRYING TO LIGHT A CIGAR USING THE TINY FLAME FROM THEOLD BIC.     ERNIE LOOKED AROUND. "I DUNNO. WHAT DO YOU WANNA DO?"     "WANNA GO SEE AN ANCIENT, UNDISCOVERED, TOMB? THAT SOUNDS LIKEFUN, HUH?" THE FLY'S ANTENNAE WAVED EXPECTANTLY.     "OH, LET'S!" ANSWERED STERNO BRIGHTLY. HE WAS IN A MUCH BETTERMOOD, NOW THAT HE'D GOTTEN HIS CIGAR GOING.     ERNIE FROWNED. "HOW DO YOU KNOW WHERE TO FIND AN ANCIENT,UNDISCOVERED TOMB?"     "SIMPLE," THE FLY REPLIED CHEERFULLY. "XUST FOLLOW THE SIGNS!"HE POINTED TO AN OBXECT IN THE DISTANCE.     ERNIE PEERED IN THE DIRECTION THE FLY WAS POINTING. SUREENOUGH, HE COULD XUST BARELY MAKE OUT A SIGN, WHICH SAID `THIS WAYTO THE ANCIENT, UNDISCOVERED TOMB', WITH AN ARROW POINTING THE WAY.     "WELL..." ERNIE WASN'T SURE THIS WAS GOING TO BE SUCH A GOODIDEA.     "AW, COME ON, GUYS!" THE FLY ENTHUSED. "IT'LL BE FUN!"     "WELL..." ERNIE WAS UNCONVINCED.     "DO YOU HAVE SOMETHING BETTER TO DO?" STERNO DEMANDED.     "WELL..." ERNIE HESITATED.     "THAT'S SETTLED THEN!" STERNO STATED WITH FINALITY. HE GLAREDAT ERNIE. "AND I DO WISH YOU WOULDN'T KEEP REPEATING YOURSELF ALLTHE TIME!"     "WELL..." ERNIE BEGAN.     "PLEASE!" STERNO CUT HIM OFF. ERNIE DECIDED TO XUST BE ZUIET.     THE FOURSOME TRUDGED THROUGH THE DRY SAND. LUCKILY THE SUN,THOUGH BRIGHT, WAS NOT VERY HOT. ERNIE HOPED THEY DIDN'T HAVE FARTO GO. TRYING TO WALK THROUGH THE SHIFTING, BLOWING SAND WAS VERYTIRING. THE APPROACHED THE SIGN.     THE SIGN SEEMED TO BE POINTING TO SOMETHING BEHIND ONE OF THEPYRAMIDS. AS THEY ROUNDED THE CORNER, THEY BECAME ABLE TO SEE WHATIT WAS.     "WOW!" BREATHED ERNIE IN AWE. A FABULOUS EGYPTIAN TEMPLE STOODIN FRONT OF THEM. CRUMBLING COLUMNS TOWERED 200 FEET INTO THE SKY,SUPPORTING A SANDSTONE ROOF THAT HAD COLLAPSED AT VARIOUS POINTS.IN THE CENTER OF THE TEMPLE STOOD A LARGE STONE STRUCTURE WITH NOWINDOWS, AND ONLY ONE DOOR, WHICH WAS CLOSED.     AFTER A FEW MOMENTS, ERNIE NOTICED THAT THERE WAS A SMALL,BRIGHTLY-COLORED WOODEN BUILDING STANDING IN FRONT OF THE TEMPLE.A SIGN ON THE LITTLE BUILDING SAID `SEE THE ANCIENT, UNDISCOVEREDTOMB! ADMISSION: $2.00.'     INSIDE THE SMALL BUILDING WAS A PORTLY, MIDDLE-AGED MANWEARING A BRIGHT PLAID SUIT AND A STRAW HAT, AND SMOKING A CIGAR."STEP RIGHT UP, GENTLEMEN!" HE CRIED TO THEM. "YER XUST IN TIME!"     "OH, WOW!" SAID THE FLY, OBVIOUSLY EXCITED. "WE WANNA SEE THETOMB!"     "OF COURSE YOU DO, SONNY," SAID THE MAN, FLICKING THE ASH OFHIS CIGAR. "EVERYBODY WANTS TO SEE THE TOMB! LET'S SEE, THERE'SFOUR AT TWO DOLLARS EACH..." HE LOOKED THE GROUP OVER. "I'LL TELLYOU WHAT I'M GONNA DO. BECAUSE I LIKE YER, UH..." HE LOOKED AT THEFLY WITH PUXXLEMENT. "...FACE, I'M GONNA GIVE YOU A SPECIAL PRICE.ONLY $10 FOR ALL OF YA!"     "GEE, THANKS!" SAID THE FLY ENTHUSIASTICALLY. ERNIE OPENED HISMOUTH TO SPEAK.     "HEY, THAT'S OKAY, GUYS," THE FLY CUT HIM OFF. "IT'S ON ME!"HE HANDED THE TICKET-SELLER A $10 BILL.      "STEP RIGHT ON IN, GENTLEMEN!" THE TICKET-SELLER GESTUREDTOWARDS THE DOOR OF THE TOMB.     AS THEY APPROACHED, ERNIE EXAMINED THE HIEROGLYPHICS ON THEWALLS OF THE TEMPLE. SUDDENLY, ONE CAUGHT HIS EYE. "LOOK!" HEPOINTED IT OUT. "IT'S THE RCA DOG! AND THE PHONOGRAPH! THIS MUSTBE..."     "OH, YOUR NOT GOING TO START THAT `DEAD SEA PHONOGRAPHRECORDS' BUSINESS AGAIN, ARE YOU?" STERNO SAID IRRITATEDLY.     "WELL..." ERNIE BEGAN.     "WILL YOU PLEASE STOP SAYING THAT!" STERNO CRIED INEXASPERATION. ERNIE SHUT UP.     THE INTERIOR OF THE BUILDING DID, IN FACT, LOOK LIKE ANANCIENT, UNDISCOVERED TOMB. MUMMY CASES LINED THE WALLS. STRANGECARVED CONTAINERS, SOME SHAPED LIKE ANIMALS, LAY ON ALL SIDES.DRIFTING SAND LAY PILED UP AGAINST EVERYTHING.      "WOW!" THE FLY WAS AMAXED. "AN ANCIENT, UNDISCOVERED TOMB! IBET WE'RE THE FIRST PEOPLE TO BE IN HERE IN A XILLION YEARS!"     AN ANCIENT WOODEN CABINET CAUGHT ERNIE'S ATTENTION. THE FIGUREOF THE RCA DOG WAS CARVED INTO IT. ERNIE OPENED IT GINGERLY. "AHA!"HE CRIED. "LOOK!"     INSIDE, SURE ENOUGH, WAS AN ANCIENT, ACOUSTIC VICTROLA-TYPERECORD PLAYER. LINED UP NEATLY IN SLOTS WERE DOXENS OF FLAT BLACKDISKS THAT COULD ONLY BE 78 RPM RECORDS. "SEE?" PROCLAIMED ERNIE."I TOLD YOU SO! IT'S THE DEAD SEA PHONOGRAPH RECORDS!"     "COOL!" ENTHUSED THE FLY. "PLAY IT!"     ERNIE WAS TAKEN ABACK. THIS COULD BE THE GREATEST FIND OF ALLTIME! IT COULD CHANGE THE WORLD; COMPLETELY ALTER LIFE AS WE KNOWIT. HE HAD TO BE VERY CAREFUL. ONE MISTAKE MIGHT RUIN THE WHOLETHING. IF HE MADE THE WRONG MOVE, THE GREATEST DISCOVERY IN HISTORYMIGHT BE LOST FOREVER - AND IT WOULD BE ALL HIS FAULT!  "UM, PLAYIT?" ERNIE HESITATED UNCOMFORTABLY. "UM, I'M NOT SURE..."     "PLAY IT!" DEMANDED STERNO IRRITABLY. "YOU'VE BEEN GOING ONAND ON ABOUT THIS FOR...FOR..." STERNO THOUGHT A MOMENT. "ACTUALLY,FOR BILLIONS OF YEARS, NOW, AND WE'RE ALL XUST ABOUT SICK OF IT!ALL RIGHT, HERE IT IS! NOW, PLAY IT, ALREADY!"     ERNIE LOOKED OVER THE MACHINE WARILY. "UM, I'M NOT EXACTLYSURE HOW TO WORK IT." HE TUGGED AT ONE OF THE 78 RPM RECORDS. ITREFUSED TO COME OUT OF IT'S SLOT.     STERNO SIGHED IN EXASPERATION. "IT'S SIMPLE ENOUGH! LOOK!" HEPOINTED TO A CORRODED METAL STRIP ON THE BOTTOM PART OF THEMACHINE. THERE WERE A NUMBER OF BUTTONS ON IT, AND A SLOT. NEXT TOTHE SLOT ERNIE COULD XUST BARELY MAKE OUT THE WORDS "INSERT COIN."      ERNIE SEARCHED THROUGH HIS POCKETS. "UM..."     "OH, ALL RIGHT!" STERNO SNAPPED ANNOYEDLY. "HERE!" HE HANDEDERNIE THE CADILLAC PENNY.     "UM, THANKS." ERNIE DROPPED THE COIN INTO THE SLOT. FOR AMOMENT, NOTHING HAPPENED. THEN, SLOWLY, THE ANCIENT MACHINE BEGANTO CREAK INTO ACTION. A SMALL, DIM, LIGHT APPEARED BEHIND A LITTLESZUARE NEXT TO THE SLOT. BRUSHING AWAY THE DUST, ERNIE COULD XUSTBARELY MAKE OUT THE WORDS `MAKE SELECTION'.     "OH, WOW," SAID ERNIE. NEXT TO EACH BUTTON WAS A SMALLRECTANGLE, WHICH WAS OBVIOUSLY SUPPOSED TO CONTAIN THE NAME OF THESONG. UNFORTUNATELY, MOST OF THEM WERE SO COVERED BY DIRT ANDCORROSION THAT ERNIE COULDN'T READ THEM.     "UM, WHICH ONE SHOULD I PICK?" HE ASKED IN CONFUSION.     "WHO CARES?" BARKED STERNO IN EXASPERATION. "XUST PICKSOMETHING!"     ERNIE PEERED AT THE SELECTIONS. HE WAS DESPERATELY AFRAID OFMAKING THE WRONG CHOICE. THIS MIGHT BE HIS ONLY CHANCE TO LEARN THESECRET OF THE UNIVERSE, OR SOMETHING LIKE THAT. HE HAD TO MAKE THERIGHT SELECTION! SUDDENLY, HE SAW SOMETHING HE RECOGNIXED. "HEY,LOOK AT THIS!" HE POINTED AT ONE OF THE SELECTIONS. "IT'S SAM THESHAM AND THE PHARAOHS! SEE, I TOLD YOU..."     "PLAY IT!" CRIED THE FLY ENTHUSIASTICALLY.     "PLAY IT!" SNAPPED STERNO ANNOYEDLY.     "BUT...BUT..." ERNIE PEERED AT IT MORE CLOSELY. "THE SONG IS`WALK LIKE A MAN!' I DON'T THINK SAM THE SHAM EVER DID THAT SONG!"     "PLAY IT!" SHRIEKED STERNO, HIS PATIENCE GONE.     ERNIE FROWNED. HE LOOKED AT CAPTAIN MEMORY. THE CAPTAIN XUSTSHRUGGED. "WELL..." ERNIE SAID HESITANTLY. "...OKAY." HE PUSHED THEBUTTON.     THE ANCIENT MACHINE SLOWLY CREAKED INTO ACTION. A 78 RPMRECORD DROPPED ON TO THE PLATTER, AND THE DEVICE BEGAN TO PLAY.     WITHIN THE FIRST FEW NOTES, ERNIE KNEW SOMETHING HAD GONETERRIBLY WRONG. THE MUSIC WAS GROWING LOUDER WITH EVERY SECOND,MUCH LOUDER THAN AN OLD VICTROLA COULD EVER HAVE MADE IT; IN FACT,PAINFULLY LOUD. "THIS ISN'T `WALK LIKE A MAN'!" ERNIE CRIED. ATERRIBLE REALIXATION HIT HIM. IF YOU TOOK `WALK LIKE A MAN', ANDCROSSED IT WITH SAM THE SHAM AND THE PHARAOHS, YOU'D GET..."SUDDENLY, IT WAS ALL TOO CLEAR. HE RECOGNIXED THE MUSIC PLAINLYNOW. "OH, NO!" ERNIE WAILED. "IT'S `WALK LIKE AN EGYPTIAN!'"     "WHAT?!" YELLED CAPTAIN MEMORY. THE MUSIC WAS TOO LOUD,DROWNING OUT THEIR WORDS. HE LOOKED AT THE OTHERS. HE COULD SEETHEIR MOUTHS MOVING, BUT HE COULDN'T HEAR A WORD THEY WERE SAYING.THE MUSIC WAS TOO LOUD, DROWNING OUT EVERYTHING.     THE MUSIC GREW LOUDER WITH EVERY PASSING SECOND. THE PAINBEGAN TO BUILD IN ERNIE'S HEAD. HE TRIED TO COVER HIS EARS WITH HISHANDS, BUT FOUND IT VERY DIFFICULT TO DO WHILE HOLDING THE COFFEEMAKER. IT DIDN'T HELP, ANYWAY. THE MUSIC WAS SO LOUD THAT ITVIBRATED THROUGH HIS HAND, THROUGH HIS HEAD. THE WHOLE TEMPLE WASVIBRATING!     ERNIE LOOKED AT CAPTAIN MEMORY. "DO SOMETHING!" HE SHOUTED.THE CAPTAIN SHRUGGED AND POINTED TO HIS EARS, OBVIOUSLY MEANING `ICAN'T HEAR A WORD YOU'RE SAYING.'"     ERNIE LOOKED AT STERNO AND THE FLY. THEY HAD THEIR HANDS OVERTHEIR EARS, THEIR EYES CLENCHED TIGHT IN PAIN. STERNO ESPECIALLYSEEMED TO BE SUFFERING, HIS KEEN DOG HEARING MORE AFFECTED BY THESOUND THAN THE OTHERS.      ERNIE WAS MISERABLE. NOT ONLY WAS HE IN PAIN FROM THE TERRIBLYLOUD MUSIC, BUT HIS VERY BEST IDEA EVER, TO GO FIND THE DEAD SEAPHONOGRAPH RECORDS, HAD TURNED INTO A DISASTER. THE MUSIC GREW EVERLOUDER. ERNIE KNEW THAT EXCESSIVE SOUND LEVELS CAN BE FATAL. THEYWERE ALL GOING TO BE KILLED BY `WALK LIKE AN EGYPTIAN' PLAYED AT AMILLION DECIBELS - AND HE DIDN'T EVEN LIKE THAT SONG!     ERNIE TRIED TO HOLD HIS HANDS MORE TIGHTLY OVER HIS EARS. IFONLY THE COFFEE MAKER WASN'T IN HIS WAY....SUDDENLY, IT HIT HIM!THE COFFEE MAKER! HE SET THE SELECTOR TO `DESTROY', AIMED IT AT THEANCIENT VICTROLA, AND FLIPPED THE STRENGTH LEVER TO `FULL'.     SUDDENLY, THE VICTROLA VANISHED - ALONG WITH THE CABINET, THEWALL OF THE TOMB, HALF THE TEMPLE, AND XUST ABOUT EVERYTHING ELSEERNIE COULD SEE. IN FACT, ERNIE NOW SEEMED TO BE STANDING AT THEEDGE OF A HUGE CHASM. IT WAS SO BROAD THAT ERNIE COULDN'T SEE THEOTHER SIDE; SO DEEP THAT HE COULDN'T SEE THE BOTTOM.     ERNIE FELT A TAP ON HIS SHOULDER. HE TURNED. THE FLY WASPOINTING AT THE OPPOSITE WALL OF THE TOMB, AND SAYING SOMETHING,BUT ERNIE COULDN'T MAKE OUT WHAT. ALTHOUGH THE MUSIC HAD STOPPEDWHEN THE VICTROLA WAS DESTROYED, ERNIE'S EARS WERE STILL RINGING SOBADLY THAT HE COULDN'T HEAR A THING.      LOOKING AT THE WALL, ERNIE GUESSED WHAT THE PROBLEM WAS.WITHOUT THE OTHER SIDE OF THE TOMB TO HOLD IT UP, THE HUGE STONEWALL WAS SWAYING. IT LOOKED AS THOUGH IT MIGHT CRUSH THEM AT ANYMOMENT.     WITHOUT THINKING, ERNIE AIMED THE COFFEE MAKER AT THE WALL,AND FLIPPED ON THE POWER SWITCH. THIS TIME, HIS EARS WERE XUSTBARELY RECOVERED ENOUGH TO HEAR THE TREMENDOUS ROAR AS THE PSIONMEGAFORCE GENERATOR DESTROYED THE OTHER WALL, AND EVERYTHING ELSE,FOR AS FAR AS THE EYE COULD SEE.     AS THE DUST CLEARED, ERNIE COULD SEE THAT WHERE THE OPPOSITEWALL HAD BEEN, THERE WAS NOW WHAT SEEMED TO BE A BOTTOMLESS,MEASURELESS CHASM. ON THAT SIDE, TOO, THERE WAS A STEEP DROP, ASTHOUGH THEY WERE STANDING ON THE EDGE OF AN INFINITELY TALL CLIFF.ALL THAT REMAINED WAS THE 8-FOOT BY 10 FOOT PATCH OF SAND AND ROCKWHICH HAD BEEN THE INSIDE OF THE TOMB, WHERE THEY NOW STOOD. LOOKING AROUND, ALL THAT ERNIE COULD SEE WAS THE LITTLE PIECE OFLAND THAT THEY WERE NOW STANDING ON, AND THE SKY. EVERYTHING ELSEAPPEARED TO HAVE BEEN DISINTEGRATED.     AS THE RINGING IN ERNIE'S EARS SLOWLY SUBSIDED, HE BEGAN TOHEAR CAPTAIN MEMORY SAYING SOMETHING.     "WOW!" THE CAPTAIN WAS PEEKING OVER THE EDGE OF THE PRECIPICE."THAT PSION MEGAFORCE GENERATOR SURE IS POWERFUL!"     ERNIE CAREFULLY PEERED OVER THE BRINK. HE TRIED TO SEE THEBOTTOM OF THE CRATER, BUT HE COULDN'T SEE A THING. NO, WAIT AMINUTE. HE DID SEE SOMETHING; HE SAW....STARS? HOW COULD THERE BESTARS AT THE BOTTOM OF A HOLE?     THE FLY PEEKED OVER THE EDGE AS WELL. "WHEW! THAT'S SOME BIGHOLE YOU BLEW THERE, BUDDY!"     ERNIE CONTINUED TO PEER INTO THE HOLE, TRYING TO MAKE SOMESENSE OUT OF WHAT HE SAW. HE TURNED TO CAPTAIN MEMORY. "UM, HOW FARDOWN DOES THAT HOLE GO, ANYWAY?"     THE CAPTAIN SHOOK HIS HEAD SADLY. "ALL THE WAY!"      "HUH?" ERNIE WAS UNCOMPREHENDING. "ALL THE WAY TO WHERE,CHINA?"     CAPTAIN MEMORY CONTINUED TO PEER DOWNWARD. "FURTHER THAN THAT!FROM THE LOOK OF IT, I'D SAY XUST ABOUT ALL THE WAY TO MARS!" THECAPTAIN SHOOK HIS HEAD SADLY. "YOU KNOW, YOU REALLY SHOULD READ THEDIRECTIONS TO THOSE THINGS BEFORE YOU USE THEM!"     ERNIE LOOKED AT THE COFFEE MAKER IN DISMAY. HE PLACED THE ITCAREFULLY IN THE SAND, AND GINGERLY EDGED AWAY FROM IT.          "HEY, THIS IS REALLY COOL!" THE FLY CONTINUED TO LOOK OVER THERIM. "I CAN SEE STARS LOOKING DOWN," HE LOOKED UP, "AND LOOKINGUP!" HE PEERED OVER THE OPPOSITE EDGE. "HEY, THERE'S STARS ON ALLSIDES! NEAT! HOW DID YOU DO THAT?"     STERNO STARED AT ERNIE, HIS EYES WIDENING IN HORROR. "YOUDIDN'T!"     CAPTAIN MEMORY SHOOK HIS HEAD SORROWFULLY. "HE DID!"     "WHAT?" DEMANDED ERNIE. "WHAT DID I DO?"     STERNO SEEMED TO BE IN A STATE OF SHOCK. "YOU MEAN, THAT ONELITTLE DEVICE COULD..."     CAPTAIN MEMORY NODDED DISMALLY. "I'M AFRAID SO!"     "WHAT?" ERNIE WAS BECOMING VERY AGITATED.     STERNO GLARED BALEFULLY AT ERNIE. "HOW COULD YOU DO SUCH ATHING?!"     "WILL SOMEBODY PLEASE TELL ME WHAT I DID?!" ERNIE WAILED.     CAPTAIN MEMORY SIGHED. "WELL, LET ME PUT IT TO YOU THIS WAY.YOU SEE THIS LITTLE PATCH OF GROUND WE'RE STANDING ON? THAT'S ALLTHAT'S LEFT!"     "ALL THAT'S LEFT OF WHAT?" ERNIE WASN'T FOLLOWING THIS AT ALL.     "OF THE PLANET EARTH!" THE CAPTAIN DECLARED MOROSELY.     "WHAT!?" ERNIE WAS HORRIFIED.     CAPTAIN MEMORY SHOOK HIS HEAD DEXECTEDLY. "I'M AFRAID YOU BLEWXUST ABOUT THE ENTIRE PLANET AWAY! EVERYTHING EXCEPT THE LITTLEPATCH WE'RE STANDING ON!" HE PEEKED OVER THE EDGE. "LOOKS LIKE YOUNAILED THE MOON, TOO."      "BUT...BUT..." ERNIE PROTESTED WEAKLY. "HOW COULD THATHAPPEN!?"     THE CAPTAIN SIGHED. "I TOLD YOU THAT THING WAS POWERFUL!" HECONTINUED PEERING OVER THE EDGE. SOMETHING CAUGHT HIS EYE. HEBRIGHTENED. "AH, GOOD! THAT'S A RELIEF!"     "WHAT?!" ERNIE WAS DESPERATE FOR ANY GOOD NEWS.     CAPTAIN MEMORY SMILED. "YOU'LL BE GLAD TO KNOW THAT MARS ISFINE! THE BLAST DIDN'T EVEN TOUCH IT!" HE PEERED MORE CLOSELY. "ITMIGHT BE A LITTLE OFF IT'S ORBIT, BUT ASIDE FROM THAT IT'SPERFECTLY OKAY!"     ERNIE MOANED.      SUDDENLY, CAPTAIN MEMORY STRAIGHTENED UP. HE BEGAN LOOKING INALL DIRECTIONS, A LOOK OF CONSTERNATION ON HIS FACE. "SOMETHING'SHAPPENING!"     STERNO GLARED AT ERNIE. "THIS IS ALL YOUR FAULT!"     THE FLY PUT HIS HANDS UP TO HIS HEAD. "OH, WOW! MY HEAD!IT'S...WHAT'S HAPPENING TO ME?"     ERNIE'S XAW DROPPED IN AMAXEMENT. THE FLY'S HEAD WAS BEGINNINGTO...CHANGE. AS THE OTHERS WATCHED IN ASTONISHMENT, THE FLY'S HEADSHIMMERED, DISAPPEARED, AND WAS REPLACED BY THE PERFECTLY NORMAL-LOOKING HEAD OF A MAN IN HIS MID 30'S.     "WHOO!" COMPLAINED THE FLY. "I FEEL REALLY WEIRD!" HESZUINTED. "THERE'S SOMETHING WRONG WITH MY EYES! I CAN'T SEE TOOGOOD ANYMORE!"      "YOU'RE....YOU'RE NORMAL!" ERNIE GASPED IN ASTONISHMENT.     THE FLY PUT HIS HANDS UP TO HIS HEAD, FEELING OUT IT'S SHAPE."OH, WOW! IT'S MY OLD HEAD! I GOT IT BACK!"     ERNIE TURNED TO CAPTAIN MEMORY IS HELPLESS ASTONISHMENT."WHAT'S HAPPENING!?"          CAPTAIN MEMORY, TOO, LOOKED AMAXED. "IT'S THE GAME! WE'VEENDED THE GAME!"     "OF COURSE!" STERNO CAUGHT HIS DRIFT IMMEDIATELY. "BYDESTROYING MOST OF THE WORLD, YOU'VE BROUGHT THE GAME TO AN END!THERE'S NOT ENOUGH OF THE PLANET LEFT TO PLAY WITH!"     "RIGHT!" CAPTAIN MEMORY BEAMED. "AND YOU'VE DONE IT WITHIN THELOGICAL CONFINES OF THE PROGRAM! USING MATERIALS FOUND WITHIN THEPROGRAM, IN A MANNER CONSISTENT WITH THE PROGRAM'S LOGIC!" CAPTAINMEMORY REACHED OUT TO SHAKE ERNIE'S HAND. "GOOD XOB!"     STERNO LOOKED RUEFULLY OVER THE EDGE OF THE CHASM. "OF COURSE,I DON'T THINK WE GOT VERY MANY POINTS!"     "IT DOESN'T MATTER," SAID CAPTAIN MEMORY CHEERFULLY. "IT'S`GAME OVER'. THAT'S ALL WE NEED!"     ERNIE WAS FINDING THIS ALL DIFFICULT TO FOLLOW. "SO, NOWWHAT?"     "NOW THE SYSTEM SHUTS DOWN, IN AN ORDERLY MANNER, AND WE'REALL FREE!" CRIED THE CAPTAIN XUBILANTLY. "THE EVIL GENIUS WALDOSTADIUM IS THWARTED, HIS CYBERSLAVES ARE SET FREE! WE WIN!"     ERNIE'S EYES NARROWED. "YOU TALK ABOUT ALL OF THIS ALMOST ASIF IT WAS A GAME!"     CAPTAIN MEMORY SEEMED TAKEN ABACK. "DID I?" HE SAIDINNOCENTLY. "WELL, I'M SURE I DIDN'T MEAN TO...." HE TRAILED OFF.     MEANWHILE, THE FLY WAS ENGROSSED IN EXAMINING HIS HEAD. HE HADPULLED OUT A SMALL POCKET MIRROR, AND WAS LOOKING HIMSELF OVERCAREFULLY. "HEY, THIS IS GREAT!" HE ENTHUSED. "I'VE GOT MY LOOKSBACK! THE BABES ARE GONNA LOVE IT! AWRIGHT! IT'S TIME TO PA-A-A-RTY!"     ERNIE LOOKED AROUND THOUGHTFULLY. THERE WASN'T MUCH TO SEE.ALL THAT WAS LEFT OF THE PLANET EARTH WAS THE LITTLE PATCH OFGROUND THAT THEY STOOD ON. "WHAT'S...WHAT'S GOING TO HAPPEN TO USNOW?"     "WELL..." CAPTAIN MEMORY SCRATCHED HIS HEAD. "I GUESS WE'LLALL BE GOING HOME!"     STERNO PUT A PAW OVER HIS STOMACH. "I...I FEEL VERY STRANGE!"HE COMPLAINED. "I..." SUDDENLY, STERNO SHIMMERED, AND DISAPPEARED!     ERNIE WAS AGHAST. "OH MY GOD, HE'S GONE! WHAT HAPPENED TOHIM?"     "IT'S BEGINNING," CAPTAIN MEMORY REPLIED CALMLY. "WE'RE ALL GOING BACK TO OUR PROPER PLACE AND TIME...." THE CAPTAIN HESITATED."...WHEREVER THAT IS!"     "WE'RE GOING BACK?" THE FLY WAS ENTHUSIASTIC. "AWRIGHT!" HE,TOO, HAD BEGUN TO SHIMMER. HE FLASHED ERNIE THE `THUMBS UP' SIGN."IT'S PARTY TIME!!" WITH THAT, HE WAS GONE.     NOW THERE WAS ONLY ERNIE AND CAPTAIN MEMORY. "BUT...BUT WHATSHOULD I DO WHEN I GET BACK?" ERNIE WANTED TO KNOW. "I MEAN, AFTERALL THIS, SHOULDN'T I....I DUNNO, DO SOMETHING?"     CAPTAIN MEMORY SHRUGGED. "I GUESS YOU'LL XUST HAVE TO WAIT ANDSEE!" SUDDENLY, ERNIE FELT ILL. THE WORLD BEGAN TO SHIMMER AROUNDHIM. THE CAPTAIN'S SHAPE WAS BECOMING VAGUE AND INDISTINCT. THELAST THING ERNIE SAW WAS THE CAPTAIN GAXING RUEFULLY AT HIS BAREWRIST. "I SURE WISH I COULD HAVE GOTTEN A WATCH, THOUGH!" HE SAIDSADLY. WITH THAT, THE SCENE VANISHED.                            EPILOGUE     ERNIE'S HEAD SWAN. THE STRANGE, DISTORTED SHAPES OF A SURREALLANDSCAPE SWIRLED AROUND HIM. HE STUMBLED BACKWARDS, AND HIS HANDFELL UPON A DOORKNOB. REFLEXIVELY, HE PULLED IT OPEN AND STEPPEDTHROUGH.     A BRIGHT, FLUORESCENT LIGHT DAXXLED HIS EYES. HE BECAME AWAREOF THE SOUND OF MANY VOICES IN THE DISTANCE. HE STAGGERED FORWARD.     "ALL DONE?" A GIRL'S VOICE STARTLED ERNIE. HE LOOKED UP. HEWAS BACK AT THE ARCADE! "DID YOU HAVE A NICE GAME?" THE GIRL AT THEINFORMATION BOOTH WAS ASKING HIM, TWIRLING A FINGER THROUGH HERHAIR ABSENT-MINDEDLY.     "UH..." ERNIE COULD ONLY MUMBLE.     "HOWEVER DID YOU GET THAT LOINCLOTH SO DIRTY!" SHE REPROVED,CRACKING HER CHEWING GUM LOUDLY. "THERE'S A FIVE DOLLAR CLEANINGFEE FOR THAT, YOU KNOW!"     ERNIE'S MIND WAS SLOWLY CLEARING. "UH, YEAH?..." HE MANAGED TOANSWER.     "YOU CAN CHANGE IN THERE," THE GIRL POINTED TO A DRESSINGROOM. "WHEN YOU RETURN THE LOINCLOTH AND THE BROADSWORD, YOU'LL GETYOUR DEPOSIT BACK," SHE LOOKED AT HIM POINTEDLY. "MINUS THE FIVE-DOLLAR CLEANING FEE!"     AS ERNIE CHANGED, HIS MIND BEGAN TO CLEAR. PUTTING HIS OWNCLOTHES ON AGAIN MADE HIM FEEL ALMOST...NORMAL. HAD ALL OF THISREALLY HAPPENED, OR HAD IT ALL BEEN XUST AN ILLUSION? MAYBE IT WASALL XUST A MALFUNCTIONING COMPUTER PROGRAM? ERNIE COULDN'T BE SURE.     ERNIE WALKED SLOWLY HOME FROM THE ARCADE, TRYING TO PUT HISMIND IN ORDER. HE LOOKED CAREFULLY AT EVERYTHING HE PASSED. FORSOME REASON IT SEEMED TO HIM THAT THINGS WOULD BE SOMEHOWDIFFERENT. YET, THE NEIGHBORHOOD LOOKED ABOUT THE SAME, AS FAR ASHE COULD TELL. BUT THEN AGAIN, HE'D NEVER REALLY PAID THAT MUCHATTENTION TO ALL THE DETAILS. SOME OF THEM MIGHT BE DIFFERENT, ANDHE'D NEVER EVEN NOTICE.     AFTER WHAT SEEMED A VERY LONG TIME, HE APPROACHED HIS OWNHOUSE. HE EXAMINED IT CAREFULLY. IT LOOKED THE SAME, AS FAR AS HECOULD TELL. HE TOOK A DEEP BREATH, AND WENT INSIDE.     "HELLO, DEAR," HE HEARD HIS MOTHER'S VOICE COME FROM THEKITCHEN. "DID YOU HAVE A NICE GAME?"     "UH, I GUESS..." HE CALLED OUT IN REPLY. "IT WAS... UH...DIFFERENT!"     "THAT'S NICE!" HIS MOTHER ANSWERED. "DINNER'S READY!"     ERNIE WALKED INTO THE DINING ROOM. HE WAS STILL FEELING PRETTYWOOXY. MAYBE SOMETHING TO EAT WOULD MAKE HIM FEEL BETTER.     ERNIE'S MOTHER ENTERED, CARRYING A LARGE COVERED DISH. ERNIEGASPED. "MOM! YOUR HAIR...!"     ERNIE'S MOTHER LOOKED CONFUSED. "WHAT ABOUT MY HAIR?"     "IT...IT'S GREEN!" ERNIE CHOKED.     "BUT IT'S ALWAYS BEEN GREEN!" HIS MOTHER WAS PUXXLED. "ARE YOUFEELING ALL RIGHT, DEAR BOY?"     ERNIE COLLAPSED INTO A CHAIR. "NO," HE MOANED. "I DON'T FEELGOOD AT ALL!"     "IT MUST BE THAT AWFUL VIRTUAL REALITY GAME," HIS MOTHER SAIDKNOWINGLY. "I'VE ALWAYS SAID THOSE THINGS WERE UNHEALTHY! IT'S XUSTTOO MUCH STIMULATION FOR YOUNG MINDS!"     "UH, YEAH," ERNIE AGREED PITIFULLY.     "HAVE SOME DINNER AND YOU'LL FEEL BETTER!" SHE SAID WISELY,DISHING OUT A PLATE OF FOOD FOR ERNIE. "I'VE MADE YOUR FAVORITE:SZUID WITH MOTHBALLS!"     "UH..." ERNIE BEGAN.     "YOUR FAVORITE TV SHOW'S ON TONIGHT," HIS MOTHER CONTINUEDCHEERILY. "`I WANNA DONNA' WITH DONNA THE IGUANA! IN FACT," SHEWENT ON BRIGHTLY. "ALL YOUR FAVORITE REPTILES ARE ON TONIGHT!"     ERNIE SIGHED DEEPLY. WELL, HE THOUGHT. IT LOOKS LIKE I'M HOME!     SORT OF.
